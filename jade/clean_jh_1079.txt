thats
not
down
thats
up
oh
well
at
least
youre
not
making
those
unsettling
gestures
john
what
are
you
doing
i
hope
youre
not
entertaining
some
awkward
train
of
thought
about
uh
what
is
with
you
today
is
your
birthday
youre
supposed
to
be
having
fun
but
youve
been
so
testy
as
if
youre
committed
to
not
having
a
good
time
yeah
i
can
see
how
you
might
find
it
a
little
slow
here
i
dunno
i
havent
minded
much
maybe
its
different
for
me
though
because
i
used
to
live
all
alone
but
i
dont
mind
doing
that
any
time
john
if
you
told
me
this
earlier
i
would
have
were
already
going
as
fast
as
i
can
make
us
go
about
the
speed
of
light
no
nothing
can
go
faster
than
light
john
unless
you
teleport
of
course
i
already
explained
this
i
cant
do
that
here
its
not
within
the
domain
of
the
green
sun
which
gives
me
those
powers
no
thats
just
a
regular
law
of
physics
jeez
ok
first
of
all
thats
not
even
close
to
the
speed
of
light
light
travels
at
a
hundred
and
eighty
six
thousand
miles
per
second
no
matter
what
frame
of
reference
youre
in
even
this
one
second
of
all
special
relativity
and
comparing
laws
of
physics
between
different
frames
of
reference
those
are
tricky
issues
to
talk
about
but
id
be
more
than
happy
to
talk
about
them
if
youd
like
actually
i
would
enjoy
that
because
i
never
really
get
to
talk
about
science
wi
yes
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
you
take
that
back
john
what
is
that
