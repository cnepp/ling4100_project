my
grandpa
set
it
up
for
me
in
the
atrium
i
would
spend
hours
tending
to
my
plants
and
playing
music
for
them
it
was
one
of
the
places
where
i
was
the
happiest
i
can
remember
being
i
miss
that
garden
it
blew
up
and
then
i
built
my
house
waaaay
up
on
top
of
where
it
used
to
be
in
the
years
since
that
happened
i
thought
about
rebuilding
it
as
a
way
to
pass
the
time
on
my
long
lonely
journey
but
i
was
too
depressed
to
grow
anything
what
sort
of
place
did
you
grow
up
in
that
didnt
have
plants
was
it
a
desert
that
sounds
lonely
but
didnt
you
say
meat
was
left
for
us
earlier
was
someone
else
there
who
oh
i
had
a
brother
too
its
funny
we
keep
discovering
ways
that
we
are
alike
