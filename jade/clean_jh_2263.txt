well
wherever
it
is
im
kinda
wondering
if
maybe
i
should
be
waking
up
soon
i
feel
like
my
friends
are
probably
going
to
need
me
why
where
my
physical
form
is
then
what
about
here
argh
sorry
this
time
stuff
is
really
confusing
yeah
i
mean
if
its
not
the
right
time
to
wake
up
where
im
sleeping
how
long
do
i
have
to
wait
here
in
order
to
wake
up
really
all
of
them
i
understand
how
this
place
has
time
and
space
of
course
even
if
they
work
together
weirdly
but
i
dont
see
any
of
the
others
oh
wow
i
am
not
sure
i
totally
understand
but
that
is
pretty
interesting
yeah
i
guess
so
physics
are
all
about
space
and
time
and
such
which
are
fun
to
think
about
i
like
all
that
stuff
so
youre
saying
space
and
time
and
all
other
aspects
i
guess
are
more
closely
related
here
than
in
like
umm
more
stable
places
like
my
universe
you
said
passage
of
time
is
inseparable
from
traveling
through
space
so
if
we
were
holding
still
time
wouldnt
be
moving
either
i
see
so
if
the
cracks
werent
there
how
how
would
we
be
able
to
tell
if
we
were
moving
hmmmm
that
is
pretty
cool
too
i
love
spacey
stuff
you
talk
about
it
in
a
neat
way
it
kinda
seems
like
you
are
trying
to
educate
me
on
this
like
a
teacher
or
something
oh
heh
