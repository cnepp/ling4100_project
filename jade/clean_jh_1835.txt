so
anyway
like
i
said
she
just
finished
telling
me
that
she
was
able
to
beat
her
brother
in
this
reality
but
apparently
that
wasnt
supposed
to
happen
so
she
lived
out
the
rest
of
her
life
in
a
doomed
timeline
and
eventually
died
she
didnt
mention
how
and
then
and
then
she
did
this
kinda
fancy
transition
darn
i
dont
think
ill
do
it
justice
a
transition
to
a
story
about
my
brother
who
was
stuck
in
a
doomed
timeline
too
i
think
ill
mess
it
up
if
i
try
to
match
what
she
said
word
for
word
she
had
a
really
fanciful
way
of
putting
things
ok
so
the
bottom
line
was
almost
all
our
friends
had
died
and
johns
only
hope
was
to
return
to
his
planet
and
attempt
to
complete
his
personal
quest
