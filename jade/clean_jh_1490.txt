remember
this
dave
are
you
lying
to
me
but
i
found
it
on
your
planet
it
must
have
gotten
here
somehow
its
not
an
egg
you
really
have
a
one
track
mind
when
it
comes
to
certain
things
davesprite
was
like
that
too
i
just
figured
it
was
because
he
was
part
bird
but
no
here
you
are
going
on
about
bird
things
too
just
like
him
p
mm
hmm
and
just
because
i
have
these
pointy
ears
doesnt
mean
i
wouldnt
kill
for
some
snausages
right
now
maybe
its
a
cueball
dave
sigh
i
see
its
still
impossible
to
have
a
serious
conversation
with
you
whether
you
are
a
sassy
bird
or
not
i
thought
regular
dave
might
have
matured
a
little
over
three
years
but
i
guess
i
was
wrong
