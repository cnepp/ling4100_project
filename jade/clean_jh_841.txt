nope
i
dont
think
thats
it
for
one
thing
considering
where
we
are
i
dont
think
theres
such
a
thing
as
the
same
time
for
us
maybe
but
its
probably
more
like
the
way
it
used
to
be
with
the
clouds
in
skaia
they
didnt
always
show
you
things
but
when
they
did
they
were
selective
about
what
they
would
let
you
see
like
they
would
make
sure
you
saw
whatever
you
needed
to
see
to
make
sure
things
would
go
the
right
way
i
always
thought
i
knew
so
much
but
in
retrospect
they
gave
me
only
a
tiny
glimpse
of
the
big
picture
i
guess
it
never
felt
that
way
when
all
i
was
doing
was
looking
up
at
some
clouds
i
was
happy
to
see
whatever
was
there
but
i
guess
its
different
in
a
situation
like
this
when
you
miss
your
friends
and
you
kind
of
wish
the
dream
bubbles
would
play
along
