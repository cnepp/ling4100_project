i
know
i
cant
not
here
at
least
the
way
i
understand
it
is
becs
powers
draw
from
the
green
sun
and
the
green
sun
presides
over
our
universe
many
universes
actually
and
the
sessions
that
created
them
as
well
as
the
sessions
created
within
them
including
the
trolls
universe
and
their
session
think
of
it
like
a
giant
solar
system
but
instead
of
planets
revolving
around
the
sun
there
are
many
universes
it
is
so
bec
was
able
to
teleport
anywhere
in
the
universe
he
wanted
in
an
instant
much
faster
than
light
jack
was
able
to
do
this
too
within
our
session
and
then
when
i
inherited
those
powers
from
so
could
i
but
we
could
only
teleport
locally
which
means
bec
could
jump
to
anywhere
in
our
universe
but
not
to
another
universe
or
into
a
session
and
jack
could
jump
to
anywhere
in
our
session
but
not
outside
it
we
cant
even
jump
to
the
green
sun
itself
even
though
we
sort
of
serve
as
a
gateway
to
it
and
all
its
energy
and
once
we
leave
the
suns
domain
our
travel
is
limited
by
the
speed
of
light
like
everyone
else
for
example
the
furthest
ring
is
not
in
the
suns
domain
it
is
more
like
the
suns
medium
allowing
it
to
exist
so
if
i
wanted
to
fly
out
of
our
session
and
travel
to
the
green
sun
i
would
have
to
make
my
way
there
through
the
furthest
ring
at
the
speed
of
light
or
less
and
wherever
we
are
now
is
not
in
the
suns
domain
either
so
the
same
rules
apply
yes
i
think
youre
right
but
to
be
fair
we
were
all
the
victims
of
a
big
prank
some
really
creepy
omniscient
guy
it
doesnt
matter
much
hes
supposedly
dead
now
yes
but
its
not
all
as
bad
as
it
seems
theres
a
silver
lining
in
all
of
this
like
you
said
a
sun
presiding
over
many
universes
has
to
be
pretty
cosmically
important
who
knows
what
terrible
consequences
there
would
be
if
it
was
destroyed
or
maybe
worse
if
it
never
existed
at
all
which
is
what
made
rose
and
daves
true
mission
an
unintended
success
to
deliver
the
bomb
to
the
empty
location
the
green
sun
was
meant
to
exist
for
most
of
eternity
and
then
create
the
sun
in
the
first
place
that
is
what
the
tumor
was
for
all
along
like
i
said
we
got
played
like
a
bunch
of
suckers
