but
as
he
wandered
through
the
catacombs
down
to
the
planets
core
he
wasnt
thinking
about
freeing
fireflies
or
cleaning
up
oil
he
was
seeking
the
help
of
his
denizen
to
master
a
power
he
couldnt
control
luckily
for
him
denizens
always
seem
to
understand
what
you
want
and
more
importantly
what
you
need
whether
you
know
it
or
not
