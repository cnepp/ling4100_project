i
was
relaxing
in
our
makeshift
livingroom
giving
john
and
davesprite
some
space
to
themselves
for
a
while
so
they
could
catch
up
john
wanted
to
visit
his
home
again
so
i
happily
obliged
and
shrunk
them
both
down
so
they
could
hang
out
in
his
tiny
tall
house
it
seemed
like
the
nice
thing
to
do
but
i
came
to
regret
that
decision
more
than
any
ive
ever
made
i
was
minding
my
own
business
when
out
of
nowhere
