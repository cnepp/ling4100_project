it
is
some
sort
of
terrible
creature
my
grandpa
hunted
he
called
it
the
typheus
minion
i
always
hated
it
i
guess
so
it
is
probably
a
coincidence
though
yeah
maybe
i
guess
it
would
make
sense
for
someone
to
name
a
really
awful
web
browser
after
such
a
hideous
monster
well
sorry
i
just
found
it
sort
of
a
weird
and
creepy
thing
to
grow
up
with
p
joooohhhhhn
it
is
so
crappy
yeah
right
now
is
obviously
not
the
best
time
to
have
the
argument
about
whose
browser
is
better
but
really
john
you
should
upgrade
to
echidna
its
so
much
nicer
after
you
upgrade
your
clunky
old
computer
of
course
p
maybe
when
i
am
in
the
game
i
can
give
you
one
of
mine
oh
o
omg
john
that
is
incredible
i
cant
wait
to
make
stuff
like
that
except
all
my
awesome
stuff
exploded
with
my
room
yay
