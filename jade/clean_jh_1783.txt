what
do
you
think
it
means
callie
if
that
was
you
but
not
quite
you
then
who
was
it
i
see
an
alternate
universe
version
of
yourself
that
makes
sense
no
wonder
she
was
so
well
no
offense
to
her
but
you
are
much
friendlier
not
really
it
was
not
long
at
all
before
i
could
tell
she
was
good
actually
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
more
im
starting
to
remember
about
the
encounter
she
had
a
lot
to
say
she
mainly
told
me
stories
she
seemed
to
really
like
telling
stories
so
i
think
your
personality
must
have
been
in
there
somewhere
d
you
want
to
know
if
i
remember
any
yes
its
been
coming
back
to
me
little
by
little
i
think
i
can
retell
some
of
them
hey
i
have
an
idea
why
dont
you
help
me
do
you
have
anything
to
write
on
a
pad
of
paper
or
such
