i
just
saw
you
and
you
were
dead

were
in
a
green
suit
and
covered
in
blood
oh

it
was
terrible
if
that
was
a
future

have
to
make
sure
that
doesnt
happen

am
confused
o

am
still
not
sure

am
relieved

poor
dave
die
was
it
jack
d
what
about
your
um

about
this
is
it
something
you
would
like
to
talk
about
ghost
dad
oh
yes
he
mentioned
something
about
it
i
guess
i
didnt
realize
its
full
implications
but
time
was
short
when
we
talked
ugh
i
forgot
i
still
have
to
get
back
to
him
its
like
a
big
unpleasant
chore
hanging
over
my
head
d
anyway
dave
im
really
sorry
about
your
bro
dad
you
were
pretty
close
with
him
right
heheh
sure
dave
we
have
to
stop
him
jack
he
shouldnt
get
away
with
this
yes

dont
you
stop
jumping
around
through
time
like
a
maniac
and
stop
being
like
a
hundred
daves
all
the
time
and
come
to
my
house
so
we
can
make
a
plan
to
kill
him
oh
what
is
the
scratch
really
hmmmm
so
was
that
like
a
hint
about
what
im
supposed
to
do
d
well
maybe
im
just
being
naive
but
a
crazy
suicide
mission
does
not
sound
like
the
ideal
solution
to
me
are
you
suuuure
we
cant
beat
him
i
dont
know
if
we
should
rule
it
out
ok
thanks
dave
