whaaat
but
you
love
this
movie
but
you
were
making
such
a
big
deal
about
finally
getting
me
to
watch
it
with
you
on
your
birthday
you
were
going
on
and
on
about
how
i
wouldnt
be
disappointed
but
now
youre
saying
you
dont
like
it
really
i
was
actually
kind
of
enjoying
it
its
very
silly
i
really
dont
think
its
the
kind
of
movie
youre
supposed
to
take
all
that
seriously
john
i
dunno
but
people
can
change
their
minds
about
things
i
think
youre
allowed
to
change
your
mind
about
a
silly
movie
i
used
to
love
the
squiddles
show
when
i
was
really
young
but
as
i
got
older
i
started
to
realize
it
wasnt
as
great
as
i
thought
it
was
i
was
just
too
young
to
see
how
it
was
actually
a
flagrant
vehicle
for
selling
merchandise
and
if
you
believed
the
conspiracy
theorists
it
might
have
even
been
pushing
some
other
dark
hidden
agendas
so
i
stopped
liking
the
show
itself
as
much
but
that
didnt
change
the
fact
that
i
had
a
lot
of
fond
memories
about
it
i
still
loved
all
the
cute
characters
and
could
enjoy
it
on
a
nostalgic
level
what
is
even
the
problem
with
it
ive
just
been
watching
this
and
thinking
yup
i
can
see
why
john
was
so
obsessed
with
this
movie
its
funny
