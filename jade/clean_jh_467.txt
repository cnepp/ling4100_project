really
yes
i
got
that
you
mean
he
is
literally
a
universe
but
your
species
is
too
especially
karkat
he
is
incredibly
sarcastic
but
i
dont
do
that
i
try
to
say
what
i
mean
as
much
as
i
can
from
what
haha
you
mean
from
rose
yeah
rose
and
dave
are
like
that
all
the
time
they
inculcate
that
stuff
like
crazy
so
you
have
been
talking
to
her
a
lot
i
guess
are
you
best
friends
now
why
oh
yeah
because
you
said
she
is
blacked
out
what
the
heck
does
that
mean
yeah
i
didnt
like
the
sound
of
her
plan
either
you
did
yeah
d
jeez
i
hope
not
me
too
wow
kanaya
i
did
not
realize
how
much
we
had
in
common
well
it
sounds
like
helping
people
is
something
that
is
in
your
nature
i
can
understand
that
are
you
saying
rose
is
reckless
and
dangerous
you
mean
your
guardian
uh
oh
im
not
sure
why
but
the
sound
of
that
makes
me
really
nervous
she
didnt
mention
anything
about
this
when
we
talked
but
then
she
seemed
preoccupied
yeah
i
will
lol
yeah
i
guess
so
ok
you
can
go
do
that
and
i
guess
i
will
check
on
rose
but
theres
still
so
much
i
want
to
know
i
want
to
know
more
about
stoking
the
forge
and
breeding
the
frogs
and
about
your
time
on
prospit
and
all
that
yes
if
i
have
cause
to
oh
that
reminds
me
i
was
thinking
of
implementing
a
system
to
keep
some
of
these
confusing
conversations
simple
and
linear
yeah
i
guess
someone
told
you
aaaaa
you
see
you
nearly
just
gave
me
the
idea
for
the
plan
in
the
first
place
paradoxically
from
my
own
future
self
i
just
find
that
kind
of
thing
annoying
for
some
reason
it
doesnt
feel
right
i
would
rather
ideas
came
from
the
place
they
actually
came
from
ok
lets
put
the
system
in
play
starting
now
i
will
give
you
a
password
and
you
give
it
to
me
in
the
future
when
you
want
to
pick
up
this
conversation
again
the
password
is
croooooooooooak
it
must
be
in
all
caps
and
must
contain
precisely
ten
os
whoops
eleven
then
p
kanaya
o
that
sounded
just
a
weeeeeee
bit
sarcastic
d
you
are
just
becoming
multicultural
thats
all
i
think
i
am
learning
to
be
more
multicultural
through
karkat
as
well
it
mostly
involves
saying
fuck
a
lot
heheheheh
its
ok
hes
really
not
so
bad
ok
go
hatch
that
orb
i
will
be
waiting
later
