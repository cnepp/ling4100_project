woooooow
you
sound
really
confused
to
me
heheheh
youre
incredibly
silly
i
cant
really
tell
to
what
extent
youre
joking
around
here
rufio
what
do
you
mean
fake
ohh
like
an
imaginary
friend
heh
ok
that
sure
is
a
philosophy
you
have
there
oh
well
what
is
it
yes
sure
red
feelings
you
mean
whoooooaaaaaa
wait
really
o
um
well
i
dont
think
i
can
reciprocate
i
mean
youre
nice
but
i
dont
really
know
you
i
dont
even
know
your
name
ok
tavros
i
dont
know
if
youve
fully
thought
about
this
you
dont
actually
know
me
very
well
either
well
no
i
was
being
nice
because
i
like
to
be
nice
to
people
when
i
can
and
when
they
are
nice
to
me
but
things
are
a
little
more
complicated
than
that
you
cant
know
someone
just
by
a
few
conversations
i
mean
i
only
talked
to
you
when
i
was
asleep
i
am
kind
of
different
when
im
dreaming
i
forget
things
and
at
times
im
not
totally
sure
whats
real
dont
you
remember
thats
what
its
like
to
dream
on
prospit
sorry
i
feel
bad
about
having
to
disappoint
you
but
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
jeeeeeez
um
tavros
i
am
really
flattered
you
like
me
and
all
and
that
sure
is
confident
of
you
to
say
so
and
thats
great
buuuut
i
guess
confidence
is
one
thing
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
being
toooo
forward
i
guess
i
aaaalso
think
and
really
this
is
just
polite
friendly
advice
that
if
youre
really
confident
you
dont
always
have
to
say
it
all
the
time
it
oh
man
im
sorry
to
say
it
just
comes
of
as
a
little
insecure
and
off
putting
and
kind
of
defeats
the
purpose
and
all
things
considered
i
think
we
should
just
stay
friends
or
really
continue
building
a
friendship
in
the
first
place
since
like
i
said
we
dont
actually
know
each
other
that
well
sorry
c
aaaah
no
you
should
have
self
respect
just
oh
boy
this
is
frustrating
can
we
talk
about
this
later
i
have
some
things
to
do
why
dont
we
get
back
to
the
original
point
why
do
you
want
to
commune
with
bec
again
