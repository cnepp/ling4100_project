about
what
yes
i
didnt
make
it
with
witch
powers
though
i
captchalogued
it
hours
ago
because
karkat
told
me
to
then
at
the
last
minute
i
took
it
out
and
made
it
huge
so
we
could
escape
through
it
i
did
make
it
huge
with
witch
powers
they
also
make
things
small
yup
also
witch
powers
can
teleport
things
and
fling
things
around
through
space
at
very
high
velocities
all
sorts
of
stuff
but
to
be
honest
im
not
sure
how
much
of
that
is
attributable
to
inheriting
becs
abilities
yes
that
was
the
basic
idea
that
would
be
jake
and
yeah
i
do
believe
we
will
meet
him
in
this
session
he
said
he
had
a
bunch
of
friends
who
helped
him
make
the
bunny
im
pretty
excited
to
meet
them
all
actually
they
both
went
and
in
a
manner
of
speaking
their
mission
was
a
success
nope
they
did
not
actually
destroy
the
sun
trust
me
i
would
know
if
it
was
gone
now
that
i
know
what
i
know
it
was
kind
of
silly
of
us
to
think
it
would
ever
be
destroyed
and
as
it
happens
rose
and
dave
are
not
dead
either
i
have
received
very
reliable
reports
that
they
survived
it
will
all
be
more
clear
soon
ive
learned
a
lot
in
my
dreams
lately
heh
probably
more
than
i
ever
learned
looking
at
the
clouds
on
prospit
when
i
was
dead
there
for
a
few
minutes
i
had
one
last
very
informative
nap
the
bottom
line
is
rose
and
dave
will
rendezvous
with
the
trolls
near
the
green
sun
and
then
they
will
all
meet
us
in
the
new
session
