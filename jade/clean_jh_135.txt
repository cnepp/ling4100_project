hehehe
yeah
i
bet
hes
right
wow
no
i
dont
think
so
hes
being
a
bit
more
literal
than
that
what
did
he
say
well
what
he
meant
was
that
you
have
a
dream
self
who
is
supposed
to
wake
up
whenever
your
real
self
goes
to
sleep
we
all
do
all
four
of
us
i
mean
but
see
your
dream
self
still
stays
asleep
when
you
go
to
sleep
because
you
havent
woken
up
yet
yes
no
you
would
not
be
out
of
line
in
fact
im
asleep
now
p
no
only
i
can
do
that
because
of
my
robot
you
guys
can
probably
make
your
own
i
guess
but
you
need
to
wake
up
first
for
it
to
matter
and
maybe
by
the
time
that
happens
you
might
not
even
need
them
um
ok
well
i
dont
really
know
how
to
answer
the
second
part
but
yeah
shes
dreaming
shes
most
likely
lying
in
your
bed
troubled
and
restless
about
things
burdening
her
which
is
to
say
you
things
about
who
you
really
are
and
what
your
purpose
is
but
you
cant
start
figuring
those
things
out
yet
because
youre
not
awake
because
youre
not
ready
yet
thats
why
you
have
such
terrible
dreams
all
the
time
rose
im
sure
it
would
help
to
start
piecing
together
the
clues
to
nudge
your
subconscious
or
maybe
face
some
things
you
havent
faced
yet
i
dunno
its
for
you
to
find
out
maybe
the
stuff
you
wrote
on
your
walls
can
give
you
a
clue
the
er
didnt
dave
tell
you
he
said
he
was
going
to
tell
you
