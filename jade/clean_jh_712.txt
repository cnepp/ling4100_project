i
have
the
population
of
five
planets
to
keep
me
company
awww
d
ok
then
personally
i
think
this
trip
could
be
a
lot
of
fun
theres
no
pressure
to
do
anything
important
or
run
around
like
lunatics
anymore
we
can
just
relax
woof
whoops
there
should
be
lots
of
good
stuff
on
the
planets
also
i
would
bet
this
ship
is
stocked
with
plenty
of
military
rations
oh
yeah
durrr
problem
solved
yes
im
pretty
sure
she
knows
a
ton
of
things
now
considering
she
is
a
fully
realized
seer
of
light
im
sure
that
would
be
hilarious
but
if
you
go
i
dont
think
i
can
bring
you
back
i
cant
bring
anyone
or
anything
to
here
from
there
as
far
as
i
know
if
theres
a
way
i
havent
figured
it
out
yet
i
am
still
kind
of
new
to
this
omnipotence
thing
after
all
i
dont
know
im
sure
the
rules
exist
for
a
good
reason
though
maybe
to
somewhat
limit
the
power
and
reach
of
omnipotent
beings
if
there
are
no
limits
at
all
it
could
be
especially
dangerous
in
the
wrong
hands
like
what
happened
with
jack
then
i
guess
thats
what
we
are
semipotent
demigods
woof
woof
woof
dammit
i
havent
gotten
the
hang
of
the
woofs
yet
i
think
so
i
do
too
d
