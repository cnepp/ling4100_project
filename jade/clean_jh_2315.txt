youre
alive
and
very
different
o
ohh
wow
im
so
happy
to
see
you
even
if
you
have
gone
through
some
uh
pretty
big
changes
so
what
are
you
doing
here
are
you
asleep
too
haha
you
did
i
dont
remember
that
yeah
well
i
do
remember
that
you
seem
to
be
in
pretty
high
spirits
now
though
no
ive
spent
the
last
however
long
hiding
from
him
actually
with
calliope
shes
my
new
friend
well
i
guess
one
of
two
new
friends
by
that
name
technically
one
of
them
is
presumably
back
with
our
friends
now
the
other
just
quite
literally
flew
away
up
to
the
sun
no
p
she
is
quite
dignified
and
aloof
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
sincerely
doubt
she
has
ever
done
anything
like
a
piece
of
garbage
anyway
if
you
want
to
find
him
i
would
guess
all
you
have
to
do
is
follow
his
trail
of
destruction
see
the
cracks
like
who
sounds
like
a
good
plan
jeez
dave
i
or
davepeta
rather
i
missed
you
so
much
no
he
and
john
died
not
long
after
we
departed
i
was
so
lonely
but
i
dont
feel
too
bad
now
that
i
know
it
all
worked
out
and
their
deaths
were
just
part
of
something
bigger
going
on
thats
great
its
so
nice
to
see
youre
happy
now
even
if
technically
i
never
got
to
be
a
part
of
that
journey
for
you
oh
cool
so
what
were
things
like
in
the
timeline
youre
from
how
was
our
trip
together
haha
what
o
omg
why
wow
i
cant
believe
i
missed
this
even
if
it
didnt
go
that
well
its
still
something
i
would
have
gladly
taken
over
the
loneliness
of
that
trip
i
cant
even
say
how
much
i
thought
about
you
both
and
to
hear
that
you
and
i
actually
sniff
im
sorry
dave
davepeta
i
guess
calliope
is
right
this
must
be
part
of
my
path
as
a
space
player
someone
who
falls
back
as
she
said
maybe
being
pushed
aside
by
fate
and
like
being
deprived
of
important
people
and
experiences
no
matter
how
painful
it
is
or
how
much
you
feel
like
you
need
them
i
guess
thats
just
how
it
goes
for
us
i
think
i
never
appreciated
how
much
of
a
burden
your
aspect
was
to
you
but
i
think
im
starting
to
get
it
now
it
just
took
a
long
time
to
figure
out
what
mine
really
meant
thats
a
bit
of
an
oversimplification
but
i
think
that
can
be
one
of
the
results
of
gaining
a
deeper
understanding
of
it
or
becoming
connected
to
it
more
i
dunno
this
stuff
is
all
pretty
mysterious
p
i
dont
have
it
all
figured
out
yet
obviously
i
just
feel
pretty
sad
that
as
i
get
closer
to
understanding
my
abilities
and
true
nature
it
apparently
means
being
deprived
of
some
important
experiences
like
i
get
closer
to
my
aspect
but
further
away
from
everyone
i
love
and
further
from
feeling
like
a
person
its
just
a
really
empty
feeling
after
a
while
empty
like
space
i
guess
heh
