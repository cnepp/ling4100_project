perfect
ok
i
will
write
the
words
and
you
can
draw
the
pictures
yes
ok
where
to
begin
if
i
recall
the
first
story
was
about
how
she
defeated
her
brother
but
i
dont
remember
much
about
that
one
and
maybe
you
dont
even
want
to
hear
a
story
that
has
to
do
with
him
hmm
that
makes
sense
the
rest
of
her
stories
i
think
were
meant
to
account
for
the
differences
in
the
way
her
life
went
so
she
went
on
to
tell
another
story
not
one
about
your
brother
but
one
about
mine
well
not
exactly
