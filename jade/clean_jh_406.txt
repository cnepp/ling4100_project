omg
that
wasnt
a
senior
interloper
im
pretty
sure
youre
talking
about
my
grandpa
and
if
im
interpreting
correctly
youre
saying
you
used
bec
to
make
me
shoot
him
augh
thats
so
awful
oh
boy
ok
it
is
basically
an
old
man
who
serves
the
same
role
as
i
guess
a
lusus
does
on
your
planet
he
was
like
my
dad
he
took
care
of
me
sigh
well
im
not
blaming
you
or
anything
it
sounds
like
you
were
just
trying
to
help
and
you
did
save
my
life
but
i
mean
jeeeez
talk
about
a
misunderstanding
uh
sure
it
is
oh
nooo
how
did
that
happen
ummm
what
kind
of
device
oh
you
mean
a
wheelchair
how
did
that
happen
d
im
so
sorry
um
also
i
didnt
realize
you
were
paralyzed
not
that
im
saying
sorry
for
that
that
would
be
rude
i
think
i
am
just
saying
sorry
for
your
loss
oh
wow
nice
um
that
i
dont
know
if
i
agree
with
that
well
thats
good
i
guess
i
just
wish
maybe
youd
told
me
what
happened
when
i
was
younger
i
spent
years
wondering
about
it
when
i
was
really
young
i
was
sure
the
doll
sitting
across
from
him
did
it
and
for
a
long
time
i
was
terrified
of
the
evil
blue
girl
she
sort
of
haunted
my
childhood
and
i
had
trouble
sleeping
for
a
long
time
but
of
course
i
got
older
and
realized
that
was
silly
but
then
i
just
speculated
that
maybe
it
was
suicide
which
was
just
a
really
sad
thing
to
think
about
buuuut
even
if
you
do
i
dont
remember
you
doing
so
er
ok
