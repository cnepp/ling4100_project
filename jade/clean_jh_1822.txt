i
looked
within
myself
as
hard
as
i
could
to
see
if
there
was
some
power
i
had
in
all
my
omnipotence
to
bring
them
back
but
i
couldnt
they
were
gone
i
would
spend
the
next
three
years
on
that
ship
without
my
two
best
friends
sure
there
were
still
consorts
and
chess
guys
to
keep
me
company
but
the
loss
was
too
much
for
me
to
bear
i
felt
so
alone
