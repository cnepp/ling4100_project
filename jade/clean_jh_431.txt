hmmm
i
have
seen
this
before
i
am
very
sure
its
the
same
rifle
included
with
johns
present
but
bigger
of
course
yes
but
i
did
not
provide
the
weapons
my
penpal
did
the
guy
who
helps
me
build
the
present
we
worked
on
it
together
but
he
supplied
the
bunnys
weapons
im
pretty
sure
hes
from
the
future
because
he
said
hes
my
grandson
umm
yes
oh
no
aaaaa
please
dont
tell
anyone
i
told
you
about
him
augh
how
could
i
let
that
slip
to
you
of
all
people
wow
ok
i
wasnt
going
to
say
anything
he
didnt
want
me
to
tell
my
friends
who
he
really
was
i
guess
maybe
he
was
concerned
about
upsetting
the
timeline
i
dunno
maybe
i
have
wondered
about
that
assuming
he
is
right
he
was
so
nice
and
it
really
did
feel
like
i
was
talking
to
family
so
i
really
dont
think
he
was
making
it
up
i
couldnt
help
but
try
to
imagine
his
parents
and
more
interestingly
his
grandfather
o
i
still
wonder
who
it
could
be
although
i
guess
at
this
point
the
options
are
pretty
limited
o
like
an
heirloom
i
guess
it
could
be
do
you
even
have
those
if
you
dont
have
parents
how
could
you
ewwwwwwww
hmmmm
then
maybe
that
is
how
this
heirloom
should
work
well
i
dont
want
to
use
it
so
ill
just
dump
it
outside
the
house
with
the
trash
and
if
it
is
fated
to
find
my
penpal
one
day
then
so
be
it
maybe
you
should
have
been
nicer
to
me
in
any
case
i
dont
appreciate
the
spirit
in
which
the
gift
was
given
so
this
is
what
i
will
do
