callie
there
is
something
very
familiar
about
you
are
you
sure
weve
never
met
before
but
you
did
know
my
name
hmmm
i
cant
shake
the
feeling
that
we
have
spoken
before
maybe
in
an
old
dream
i
cant
remember
im
not
sure
if
its
the
sound
of
your
voice
or
what
i
dont
recognize
your
face
but
then
thats
not
what
you
really
look
like
is
it
thats
fine
its
not
a
big
deal
if
its
true
that
weve
met
before
im
sure
ill
remember
in
due
time
lets
not
worry
about
it
for
now
by
the
way
what
is
with
this
stage
is
it
from
one
of
your
memories
i
dont
think
so
it
would
seem
to
be
some
sort
of
imaginary
figment
that
turned
into
a
real
object
i
wonder
why
it
looks
like
a
drawing
hey
why
dont
you
come
up
here
and
help
me
get
these
curtains
open
since
its
the
only
thing
weve
got
in
this
boring
vortex
we
might
as
well
try
to
have
a
little
fun
