dont
mention
it
so
how
does
this
cloning
stuff
work
i
want
to
try
anyway
if
you
can
hold
out
hope
for
rebuilding
your
race
in
the
center
of
a
meteor
then
i
think
i
can
at
least
try
to
get
a
little
cloning
done
with
the
time
i
have
left
yes
dave
is
doing
that
at
the
top
of
this
ridiculous
tower
didnt
you
say
it
needed
to
be
in
a
warm
place
my
house
is
freezing
now
it
ran
on
geothermal
power
before
and
i
guess
theres
no
heat
anywhere
inside
this
planet
yes
i
would
like
to
hear
about
that
later
but
yeah
the
weather
seems
just
fine
out
here
in
the
medium
lets
see
how
dave
is
doing
