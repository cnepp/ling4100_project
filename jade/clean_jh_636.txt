hopefully
no
it
completely
slipped
my
mind
well
like
it
was
before
the
choices
she
gives
you
seem
to
have
to
do
with
facing
mortality
and
making
it
clear
if
you
choose
one
path
over
another
it
will
lead
to
your
death
and
that
your
death
may
even
be
necessary
to
accomplish
a
goal
yeah
but
that
is
not
really
what
made
this
hard
i
mean
nobody
wants
to
die
of
course
but
at
least
that
is
a
clear
thing
you
either
do
you
you
dont
you
know
it
might
be
she
said
that
if
i
accepted
her
help
that
i
would
have
to
make
a
promise
that
whenever
we
left
this
place
and
wherever
we
end
up
going
she
had
to
come
not
just
echidna
but
all
the
denizens
their
palaces
their
consorts
their
lands
everything
i
have
to
bring
them
all
with
us
