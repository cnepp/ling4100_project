im
starting
to
remember
the
things
she
told
me
so
vividly
now
its
amazing
what
a
creative
project
can
do
to
get
your
mind
turning
the
land
of
wind
and
shade
that
is
where
the
story
starts
hmmm
both
as
a
matter
of
fact
my
story
began
with
a
tragedy
on
lowas
which
led
to
meeting
her
in
the
first
place
and
then
she
used
my
memory
of
that
tragedy
as
a
starting
point
for
her
story
which
turned
out
to
be
related
i
know
ill
start
with
mine
since
that
will
make
everything
else
make
sense
so
go
ahead
and
start
drawing
lowas
