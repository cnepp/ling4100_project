as
i
said
she
was
somewhat
like
you
and
yet
so
unalike
her
presence
was
so
serious
and
grave
her
hollow
eyes
were
piercing
but
not
hostile
but
the
prevailing
sense
i
got
from
her
was
one
of
loneliness
before
she
even
said
a
word
i
could
feel
it
somehow
that
this
was
a
deeply
lonely
soul
until
i
met
her
i
thought
i
was
the
loneliest
person
in
the
universe
but
a
feeling
told
me
she
had
been
here
by
herself
for
a
long
long
time
i
felt
sorry
for
her
and
relating
to
her
plight
helped
me
overcome
the
feelings
of
intimidation
so
we
began
to
talk
we
traded
stories
about
ourselves
she
spoke
of
the
brother
she
killed
i
spoke
of
the
brother
i
lost
and
when
i
mentioned
johns
death
that
is
when
she
became
very
serious
again
she
began
to
recount
how
john
had
died
repeating
to
me
the
same
story
i
just
told
you
she
described
the
spontaneous
destruction
of
lowas
which
left
me
alone
for
years
i
wondered
why
she
was
recounting
this
tragedy
that
happened
to
me
and
for
that
matter
how
she
knew
of
it
herself
she
went
on
to
say
that
lowas
was
destroyed
because
johns
denizen
had
suddenly
woken
up
typheus
a
great
monster
of
truly
terrifying
power
she
said
he
had
destroyed
his
land
and
slayed
his
own
heir
of
breath
not
out
of
malice
but
to
make
a
slight
correction
i
asked
her
what
do
you
mean
correction
