now
i
remember
what
happened
to
us
janes
story
helped
jog
my
memory
of
the
final
moments
shes
right
when
i
went
to
hijack
the
meteor
there
was
someone
there
i
didnt
expect
to
see
i
think
jane
covered
the
who
pretty
well
with
her
colorful
description
already
whats
more
interesting
is

made
me
realize
ive
been

all
along
we
were
never
dead
at
all

been
asleep
