i
said
password
fuckass
whoops
sorry
ive
been
having
too
many
password
arguments
with
karkat
i
guess
p
well
it
depends
do
you
want
to
have
a
silly
conversation
or
a
serious
conversation
both
are
but
a
silly
conversation
mostly
doesnt
matter
or
make
the
timeline
more
confusing
than
it
needs
to
be
so
we
can
have
one
right
now
if
you
want
in
fact
i
would
say
it
is
coming
dangerously
close
to
being
one
already
but
if
it
is
a
serious
conversation
you
want
then
im
afraid
i
must
demand
a
password
p
nope
because
i
told
you
exactly
hehehe
yum
b
hmm
i
suppose
those
are
acceptable
to
keep
the
conversations
linear
i
gave
you
a
password
at
the
end
of
our
previous
conversation
you
have
to
give
me
that
password
to
start
our
next
conversation
this
ensures
that
past
you
cant
jump
ahead
into
the
conversation
and
mess
everything
up
like
you
are
trying
to
do
now
i
know
but
trust
me
its
better
this
way
i
dont
know
i
have
no
idea
what
time
you
are
from
but
you
will
get
it
i
gave
it
to
you
some
time
ago
at
the
end
of
our
last
conversation
and
i
have
been
eagerly
awaiting
your
linear
and
unconfusing
reply
ever
since
bye
kanaya
