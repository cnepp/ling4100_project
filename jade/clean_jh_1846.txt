drowning
obviously
would
have
been
bad
p
but
disappearing
wouldnt
be
much
better
he
would
appear
somewhere
else
having
made
no
progress
on
his
personal
quest
his
planet
would
still
be
polluted
and
he
would
be
no
closer
to
playing
his
song
somehow
he
understood
the
only
way
was
to
conceive
of
a
third
option
an
idea
beyond
the
simple
binary
set
of
outcomes
before
him
and
interestingly
it
was
coming
to
this
understanding
which
gave
him
the
first
glimpse
of
how
to
control
the
power
he
realized
it
wasnt
himself
that
he
needed
to
make
disappear
