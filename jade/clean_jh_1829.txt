yes
but
there
are
also
supposed
to
be
glitches
around
like
computery
glitches
i
think
ok
why
dont
we
not
worry
about
showing
the
glitches
for
this
story
they
would
just
make
it
harder
to
see
whats
going
on
which
is
probably
the
point
now
that
i
think
about
it
i
never
thought
much
about
it
it
just
seemed
like
a
weird
detail
she
mentioned
but
i
guess
it
was
some
strange
form
of
corruption
in
their
session
that
made
everything
harder
to
understand
no
idea
i
guess
it
was
just
one
more
way
everything
got
messed
up
for
them
like
just
another
surreal
obstacle
for
a
hero
to
overcome
oh
that
reminds
me
you
need
to
draw
john
there
as
well
