yeah
the
poor
froggies
youre
probably
right
they
really
seem
to
drive
him
crazy
this
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
had
to
reprimand
him
he
was
growling
at
echidna
and
i
had
to
tell
him
he
was
being
very
bad
he
destroyed
some
of
her
really
nice
statues
too
keeping
him
in
line
really
makes
me
miss
bec
he
was
such
a
good
dog
not
to
mention
a
best
friend
jack
is
just
exactly
huh
