when
she
mentioned
that
i
didnt
give
it
a
second
thought
but
now
that
i
am
trying
to
reconstruct
everything
and
tell
you
what
to
draw
hmm
i
guess
when
youre
trying
to
tell
a
story
it
forces
you
to
think
a
lot
more
about
everything
than
when
youre
just
listening
to
one
let
me
think
hmm
maybe
we
should
pause
before
i
go
on
like
some
sort
of
intermission
so
i
can
collect
my
thoughts
a
bit
and
to
give
the
audience
a
little
breather
between
two
significant
arcs
we
were
at
it
for
a
pretty
good
while
there
after
all
well
that
would
be
you
in
this
case
ooh
i
know
i
can
doodle
a
quick
story
about
the
antics
of
the
silly
consorts
on
the
golden
ship
before
moving
on
