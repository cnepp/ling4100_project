no
not
for
me
there
isnt
there
is
nothing
but
death
and
sadness
and
destruction
here
theres
no
hope
and
i
dont
see
anything
worth
fighting
for
that
is
a
horrible
thing
to
say
i
dont
belong
here
anyway
really
none
of
this
is
my
business
anymore
and
i
want
to
go
home
augh
that
is
so
selfish
i
cant
believe
this
how
can
you
say
these
things
dont
you
remember
anything
that
the
queen
told
us
that
we
would
eventually
build
a
new
world
and
make
a
future
together
with
our
friends
dont
you
remember
being
excited
about
finding
out
what
that
meant
yes
but
it
was
just
a
story
it
was
never
going
to
come
true
yes
it
will
some
of
us
the
ones
who
still
have
hope
are
fighting
for
that
right
now
how
can
you
have
such
a
negative
outlook
on
absolutely
everything
boo
hoo
ho
shut
up
stop
being
such
a
damn
crybaby
really
we
both
had
the
exact
same
experiences
and
look
i
am
managing
to
keep
my
head
up
see
you
dont
even
have
the
full
picture
either
because
you
checked
out
early
you
didnt
have
to
stand
by
as
bec
gave
jack
his
powers
when
you
might
have
been
able
to
stop
that
and
you
didnt
have
to
watch
as
jack
became
so
strong
he
could
appear
anywhere
and
kill
anyone
you
loved
at
any
moment
you
didnt
have
to
see
a
dave
lying
in
his
own
blood
what
dave
he
died
too
no
see
ohhhh
boo
hey
no
youre
not
allowed
to
cry
about
that
because
you
didnt
see
it
thats
the
whole
point
you
are
just
looking
for
any
excuse
you
can
to
be
sad
and
useless
and
its
starting
to
piss
me
off
sniffle

whimper
