hi
happy
birthday
rose
did
you
get
johns
present
yet
yeah
i
know
what
will
you
make
with
it
well
john
did
tell
me
what
it
was
duh
oh
but
rose
i
dont
think
he
meant
anything
like
that
by
it
you
see
not
everybody
always
means
the
opposite
of
what
they
say
the
way
you
and
dave
always
do
yep
i
finally
finished
a
present
for
him
ive
been
working
on
it
for
years
heheheh
i
just
mailed
it
too
so
it
is
sure
to
get
there
on
time
mail
takes
a
while
to
get
anywhere
from
here
i
dont
think
you
really
mean
that
err
no
sorry
but
you
are
sort
of
hard
shop
for
besides
i
have
something
for
you
today
that
i
think
you
will
like
better
than
some
thing
in
a
box
it
is
a
tip
did
you
have
a
pet
a
long
time
ago
that
died
ok
well
how
did
you
feel
about
your
cat
did
you
love
him
a
lot
ummmmm
ok
thats
fine
it
doesnt
really
matter
i
think
just
what
if
someone
told
you
you
could
play
a
game
that
would
bring
him
back
to
life
yes
that
someone
is
me
i
just
thought
you
might
find
it
interesting
oh
i
dont
know
im
just
saying
is
all
i
think
youll
hear
about
it
later
and
maybe
you
can
talk
to
john
and
dave
about
it
they
are
way
more
into
all
that
stuff
than
i
am
