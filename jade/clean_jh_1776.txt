foliage
huh
thats
interesting
ummm
heheh
yeah
i
guess
not
you
havent
o
that
sounds
terrible
when
i
was
a
kid
i
grew
up
with
plants
all
around
me
but
i
was
very
lucky
i
guess
i
took
all
the
nice
things
about
my
life
on
this
island
for
granted
i
even
had
my
own
garden
where
i
grew
flowers
and
vegetables
and
fruits
and
such
that
is
all
i
ever
ate
the
things
i
grew
myself
but
i
will
admit
to
having
developed
a
taste
for
meat
since
becoming
a
dog
