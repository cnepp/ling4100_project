rose
please
say
something
you
are
making
me
nervous
umm
because
you
were
busy
trying
to
make
the
best
of
this
situation
i
dont
think
you
should
be
so
hard
on
yourself
about
it
john
was
being
john
and
you
were
being
you
which
i
guess
meant
taking
our
problems
very
seriously
and
putting
all
your
attention
on
solving
them
and
anyway
you
and
your
mom
had
a
much
trickier
relationship
than
john
and
his
dad
didnt
you
i
mean
not
that
i
am
saying
that
means
you
were
any
less
attached
to
her
than
him
argh
i
dont
know
if
im
very
good
at
consoling
people
sorry
rose
i
dont
want
to
make
you
feel
worse
whew
ok
you
know
now
we
have
all
lost
guardians
dave
lost
his
and
i
lost
mine
in
a
weird
way
uuum
even
though
that
was
pretty
much
definitely
my
fault
and
even
the
trolls
all
lost
their
monster
guardians
i
think
that
maybe
it
is
an
inevitable
part
of
a
game
that
can
be
cruel
sometimes
i
am
so
sad
rose
i
think
you
are
being
stronger
about
it
than
i
am
oh
well
i
just
hope
you
arent
thinking
of
doing
something
rash
yeaaah
errrr
i
dont
know
wellllll
no
but
i
was
trusting
that
you
had
thought
it
through
and
it
was
our
best
hope
hm
then
what
will
you
do
what
does
that
mean
oh
no
no
no
no
no
rose
that
is
a
much
much
worse
plan
he
would
probably
kill
you
i
know
what
you
mean
i
was
angry
at
jack
and
wanted
to
stop
him
too
but
we
have
to
think
of
a
more
sensible
way
to
do
it
what
who
aaaaaaa
whaaaaat
rose
who
is
this
i
dont
even
know
whats
going
on
anymore
shhhhhhhhhh
please
dont
rose
i
know
you
are
angry
but
you
arent
thinking
straight
nooo
rose
maybe
white
text
guy
is
right
the
dark
gods
gave
you
all
these
powers
and
seem
to
be
helping
us
with
dream
bubbles
and
stuff
but
what
if
they
are
not
actually
good
no
but
i
still
dont
trust
them
whats
this
weirdo
talking
about
oh
yeah
i
noticed
you
found
it
i
was
worried
it
had
been
destroyed
when
my
room
blew
up
is
he
saying
you
can
use
it
omg
does
it
work
then
maybe
you
should
try
it
well
since
we
dont
know
much
about
the
gods
why
dont
you
ask
it
about
them
i
guess
that
is
a
way
to
put
it
