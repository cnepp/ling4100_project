i
wish
i
could
tell
you
but
im
still
drawing
a
blank
on
everything
i
dont
even
remember
what
i
was
doing
when
i
fell
asleep
or
even
if
im
sleeping
er
how
are
you
supposed
to
tell
if
youre
a
ghost
or
not
darn
what
anti
sleeping
magics
i
mean
majyyks
what
reasons
aw
thats
ok
im
in
no
hurry
to
go
yet
or
for
that
matter
to
remember
why
im
here
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
but
i
have
this
awful
feeling
something
bad
happened
specifically
something
that
happened
because
of
me
yeah
im
worried
i
may
have
done
some
things
i
wouldnt
be
proud
of
that
maybe
i
could
have
even
hurt
some
people
i
hope
its
just
my
imagination
in
any
case
i
feel
like
i
could
use
some
rest
and
you
seem
very
nice
so
id
rather
relax
here
with
you
for
a
while
than
jump
right
back
into
whatever
craziness
is
waiting
for
me
out
there
by
the
way
i
didnt
catch
your
name
your
trollsona
nice
to
meet
you
too
callie
but
what
is
a
trollsona
oh
oh
i
get
it
you
are
not
really
a
troll
omg
she
is
so
cute
or
i
should
say
you
are
so
cute
what
a
good
idea
do
you
think
i
could
make
a
trollsona
too
sure
the
best
color
obviously
which
is
green
duh
p
wow
really
thats
perfect
our
trollsonas
can
be
like
blood
sisters
or
such
i
dont
know
enough
about
troll
culture
to
use
proper
terminology
but
lets
just
say
thats
what
we
are
what
should
my
horns
look
like
oh
and
for
that
matter
should
i
have
horns
instead
of
my
dog
ears
or
in
addition
to
them
ok
hmm
where
would
they
go
though
jeez
i
think
we
might
need
to
do
some
drawings
to
make
her
look
right
