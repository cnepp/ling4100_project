i
dont
want
to
be
here
i
have
to
go
back
but
i
dont
know
how
can
you
help
me
you
want
me
to
help
you
die
again
yes
i
think
thats
what
i
would
like
i
cant
take
this
i
wasnt
ready
to
come
back
not
like
this
wow
ok
i
know
this
is
my
fault
but
that
is
a
really
hard
thing
to
ask
me
to
do
even
if
it
was
possible
the
way
you
are
now
i
dont
think
i
could
go
through
with
it
boo
hoo
hoo
hoo
hoo
ok
ok
shhhhh
listen
i
never
did
tell
you
why
i
brought
you
back
and
it
may
be
that
if
you
attempt
what
i
wanted
you
to
do
in
the
first
place
god
i
cant
believe
im
saying
this
but
you
might
end
up
getting
what
you
want
anyway
because
it
was
always
going
to
be
risky
what
is
it
well
you
remember
the
guy
who
destroyed
prospit
oh
god
d
ohh
god
noooooo
shh
anyway
he
is
the
reason
i
brought
you
here
he
has
the
same
powers
you
have
making
him
unbeatable
to
us
but
maybe
not
you
so
you
could
go
find
him
and
you
want
me
to
fight
him
um
are
you
crazy
do
i
look
like
i
am
ready
to
fight
anybody
i
just
thought
as
long
as
youre
here
i
cant
fight
anybody
i
am
scared
and
confused
and
sad
and
i
wouldnt
even
know
how
to
begin
fighting
that
horrible
guy
i
would
be
too
afraid
of
him
to
even
go
find
him
but
i
thought
you
wanted
to
die
you
wouldnt
go
even
if
he
could
no
i
dont
want
him
to
kill
me
you
just
dont
understand
aaaaa
boo
hoo
hoo
jeez
youre
right
i
really
dont
boo
hoo
hoo
hoo
i
said
shh
wow
i
dont
mean
to
be
insensitive
but
there
is
a
lot
at
stake
here
woof
i
pfhehe
dont
change
the
subject
i
mean
dont
you
remember
what
this
was
all
about
what
you
were
working
for
what
we
were
working
for
all
those
years
before
you
died
remember
what
we
saw
in
the
clouds
or
what
the
queen
told
us
uh
how
could
you
not
remember
john
survived
we
both
saw
him
in
a
cloud
he
was
in
his
dream
suit
and
awake
reading
our
letter
didnt
you
think
about
that
ummmm
so
what
does
it
matter
it
was
all
a
lie
what
we
saw
in
the
clouds
and
all
that
none
of
it
meant
anything
what
how
can
you
say
that
it
was
a
nice
life
but
everything
we
did
lead
to
nothing
john
and
i
both
died
and
i
eventually
accepted
that
and
moved
on
john
didnt
die
omg
this
is
so
frustrating
i
just
told
you
he
didnt
i
knew
i
was
kind
of
ditzy
and
forgetful
in
my
dreams
but
boooo
ho
shhhhh
okaaaaaay
jeez
i
just
dont
know
what
to
think
i
guess
you
are
part
of
me
and
you
are
who
i
was
when
i
slept
but
it
makes
me
sad
to
think
i
would
act
like
this
act
like
what
i
would
like
to
think
that
even
if
i
was
sad
and
scared
if
i
was
put
in
a
position
where
everyone
depended
on
me
i
could
put
all
those
feelings
aside
and
do
whats
right
but
i
dont
know
whats
right
yes
you
do
even
though
you
dont
want
to
be
youre
here
now
and
there
are
still
people
who
need
you
there
is
still
something
worth
fighting
for
