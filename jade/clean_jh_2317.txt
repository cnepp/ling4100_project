so
different
but
youre
still
dave
in
a
way
its
hard
to
say
how
happy
it
makes
me
to
see
you
doing
well
i
think
so
im
asleep
i
want
to
go
join
our
friends
and
help
out
but
im
not
supposed
to
wake
up
i
dunno
im
just
not
calliope
said
i
was
too
strong
or
something
but
she
also
said
i
should
have
fun
so
i
dunno
i
guess
im
just
waiting
around
for
the
right
moment
really
leaving
what
up
to
me
the
decision
to
wake
up
but
i
dont
know
how
