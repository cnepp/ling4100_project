yes
thats
what
a
perfectly
generic
object
is
how
exactly
if
you
want
your
powers
to
reach
their
full
potential
youre
going
to
need
to
become
more
familiar
with
the
fundamental
building
blocks
of
ideas
and
how
they
translate
into
more
complicated
thoughts
and
forms
then
it
becomes
a
simple
matter
of
using
your
abilities
to
snatch
those
concepts
from
unreality
we
both
know
you
dont
think
its
too
hard
you
think
it
sounds
like
an
interesting
challenge
this
is
a
very
good
start
though
with
a
little
practice
im
sure
our
empress
will
have
her
orb
in
no
time
