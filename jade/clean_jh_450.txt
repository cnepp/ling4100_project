what
are
you
getting
at
well
i
mean
i
understand
why
she
is
upset
but
she
is
completely
inconsolable
and
wont
listen
to
reason
about
anything
and
i
guess
i
could
deal
with
that
but
the
frustrating
thing
is
that
shes
actually
me
i
really
dont
think
i
would
act
like
that
will
you
stop
saying
hmm
fascination
what
do
you
find
so
fascinating
my
feelings
well
at
first
i
was
sad
because
she
made
me
remember
all
the
sad
things
that
just
happened
but
im
trying
to
be
strong
about
all
that
so
we
can
keep
moving
forward
and
if
i
can
then
why
cant
she
but
she
just
went
on
and
on
and
i
started
getting
angry
ugh
i
have
never
been
so
angry
in
my
life
i
said
stop
saying
fucking
hmm
what
does
that
mean
is
that
supposed
to
be
someone
with
a
halo
and
goofy
teeth
are
you
making
fun
of
me
oh
haha
oops
yeah
pretty
much
considering
what
oh
come
on
this
is
nothing
like
that
because
shes
well
shes
actually
insane
but
those
are
you
im
not
her
i
dont
know
it
just
oh
my
god
youre
right
