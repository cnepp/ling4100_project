i
would
be
careful
about
the
slurs
you
bandy
about
particularly
those
targeting
my
canine
qualities
which
i
am
sensitive
about
and
therefore
find
to
be
really
really
mean
you
should
be
aware
that
i
have
already
threatened
to
kill
some
people
today
so
watch
your
step
mister
its
true
though
i
am
very
threatening
and
this
girl
right
here
shes
even
worse
she
hasnt
even
said
a
word
that
is
terrifying
jeez
even
im
nervous
and
kanaya
dont
think
you
are
safe
from
our
threats
just
because
you
happen
to
be
a
vampire
we
have
ways
of
handling
the
undead
jane
here
she
has
the
power
to
bring
people
back
to
life
although
it
is
my
understanding
that
this
ability
is
limited
to
a
one
time
only
use
per
individual
you
do
know
what
sort
of
effect
her
resurrection
spell
will
have
on
undead
targets
