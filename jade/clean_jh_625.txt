i
wonder
if
we
will
ever
be
able
to
start
a
conversation
without
having
a
ridiculous
argument
about
the
password
system
why
would
i
want
to
do
that
the
only
guy
whos
dumber
than
past
karkat
is
future
karkat
and
vice
versa
i
have
this
on
good
authority
from
both
sources
you
see
that
is
your
problem
okay
one
of
your
many
many
problems
you
have
no
patience
to
do
things
the
right
way
youre
always
just
looking
for
the
shortcut
even
if
doing
so
has
brought
you
nothing
but
trouble
a
hundred
times
before
it
is
sort
of
funny
that
the
only
thing
standing
in
your
way
is
one
of
your
other
problems
your
preposterous
self
loathing
so
you
cant
even
trust
your
future
self
to
help
you
cheat
its
like
you
have
so
many
problems
they
cancel
each
other
out
exactly
d
ok
yes
yes
we
still
are
this
little
detour
was
related
to
that
task
we
should
be
nearly
done
i
can
understand
her
just
fine
we
already
talked
about
this
echidna
and
i
have
an
understanding
now
well
maybe
if
you
werent
in
such
a
grumpy
hurry
all
the
time
you
wouldnt
have
killed
your
denizen
so
quickly
you
might
have
actually
learned
something
did
you
ever
talk
to
kanaya
about
it
her
situation
was
very
similar
to
mine
it
doesnt
sound
like
you
got
the
whole
story
or
maybe
you
just
werent
listening
to
her
p
this
was
kanayas
suggestion
yes
im
talking
to
her
right
now
actually
durrr
of
course
not
shes
from
a
different
time
than
you
genius
a
few
hours
in
your
future
you
are
so
ridiculous
i
have
kanaya
using
the
same
password
system
as
you
she
is
just
a
little
further
ahead
on
my
timeline
is
all
it
would
be
pretty
hard
to
keep
you
both
synced
up
yeah
from
my
future
i
dont
want
you
guys
telling
me
the
things
i
do
before
i
do
them
because
you
talked
to
future
me
but
knowing
a
few
things
about
your
future
doesnt
really
matter
not
that
i
am
going
to
tell
you
any
of
it
so
dont
ask
siiign
what
are
you
even
talking
about
aw
well
youll
find
him
i
know
i
made
an
exception
but
only
one
kanaya
thinks
we
should
all
talk
about
this
she
says
youre
important
to
consult
on
the
matter
but
the
you
from
her
time
is
too
busy
x
she
is
opening
a
memo
