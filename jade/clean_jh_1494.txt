it
wont
be
earth
for
much
longer
it
will
be
home
to
the
new
empire
i
will
deliver
it
to
the
universe
we
create
or
i
should
say
the
one
you
create
if
you
are
obedient
and
complete
the
tasks
you
are
assigned
you
may
have
a
place
in
the
empire
among
the
subservient
classes
karkat
i
had
almost
forgotten
how
much
i
missed
our
repartee
thank
you
for
reminding
me
that
outburst
was
beautiful
if
youre
frustrated
by
the
way
im
treating
you
look
at
it
this
way
im
not
asking
you
for
passwords
anymore
am
i
sorry
karkat
there
is
no
password
not
this
time
if
you
continue
to
list
meat
products
then
im
afraid
the
only
thing
you
will
unlock
is
my
fearsome
doggy
hunger
and
believe
me
you
dont
want
to
see
me
when
im
doggy
hungry
but
if
you
insist
on
hounding
me
hehe
for
some
sort
of
explanation
its
all
pretty
simple
we
all
recently
arrived
in
this
brand
new
session
janes
session
actually
this
is
jane
btw
say
hi
jane
lol
jane
is
actually
my
biological
mother
believe
it
or
not
shh
but
her
session
was
taken
over
by
the
woman
who
you
might
call
our
mutual
great
grandmother
shes
an
alien
a
very
powerful
troll
queen
actually
karkat
you
are
the
one
who
demanded
an
uninterrupted
spate
of
hard
unembellished
data
ill
thank
you
to
not
to
yell
at
me
for
doing
exactly
what
you
requested
her
imperious
condescension
is
in
control
now
she
intends
to
carry
out
the
remaining
objectives
to
complete
the
session
those
tasks
will
be
distributed
among
several
recently
recruited
agents
of
course
thats
you
this
should
come
as
a
relief
to
you
since
it
means
you
and
she
are
not
in
opposition
at
all
in
fact
you
share
all
the
same
goals
the
only
difference
is
that
when
the
time
comes
she
will
be
the
one
claiming
the
ultimate
reward
the
spoils
will
be
hers
not
ours
get
it
excellent
what
you
will
need
to
do
is
ready
the
young
frog
for
its
journey
to
skaia
i
will
prepare
skaia
to
receive
it
by
deploying
the
battlefield
from
our
old
session
this
will
bring
fertility
to
the
void
session
and
allow
the
frog
to
mature
when
he
completes
his
journey
no
i
already
made
one
actually
dont
you
remember
really
your
job
is
so
easy
theres
no
more
frog
breeding
involved
at
all
when
the
time
is
right
you
just
have
to
release
the
one
thats
already
there
it
fell
into
the
forge
in
the
years
since
it
has
sunk
all
the
way
down
to
the
planets
core
but
as
it
happens
that
is
exactly
where
it
should
be
my
denizen
is
now
guarding
it
as
im
sure
kanaya
already
knows
it
will
not
be
released
unless
you
travel
there
and
formally
request
that
she
do
so
i
already
did
echidna
will
not
speak
with
me
it
is
not
important
why
and
it
changes
nothing
she
said
she
would
only
speak
with
another
hero
of
space
that
would
be
kanaya
she
also
cryptically
requested
the
presence
of
the
knight
who
once
helped
her
with
breeding
duties
karkat
i
gather
that
would
be
you
i
dont
know
karkat
that
is
your
problem
not
mine
maybe
you
should
try
feeling
grateful
she
asked
for
you
youre
getting
the
chance
to
set
right
what
went
so
horribly
wrong
to
atone
for
your
hasty
first
attempt
at
frog
breeding
which
resulted
in
a
terminal
universe
if
i
were
you
i
would
feel
pretty
relieved
to
get
a
second
chance
but
thats
just
me
p
