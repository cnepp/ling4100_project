she
said
that
the
john
from
my
reality
and
his
entire
planet
needed
to
be
erased
and
that
the
slumbering
denizen
in
all
his
mysterious
wisdom
knew
this
she
told
me
that
the
dreams
of
a
denizen
draw
from
the
same
well
of
potential
from
which
every
conceivable
possibility
arises
the
same
place
skaia
gets
its
power
from
so
if
an
agreement
with
a
denizen
is
reached
in
one
reality
that
same
denizen
in
another
reality
could
become
aware
of
it
and
respond
accordingly
it
seems
that
john
somewhere
in
some
other
plane
of
existence
had
made
just
such
an
agreement
she
said
that
the
john
i
knew
like
herself
was
only
one
version
of
a
person
there
was
a
different
version
of
john
from
another
reality
poised
to
play
a
more
significant
role
you
see
the
john
from
that
reality
in
an
act
of
desperation
had
gone
to
see
typheus
and
struck
a
bargain
with
him
she
would
go
on
to
explain
the
nature
of
that
bargain
in
the
next
part
of
her
story
but
from
my
perspective
the
consequence
of
this
bargain
was
to
lose
my
friends
and
to
live
with
that
for
years
without
understanding
why
losing
them
still
hurt
but
i
was
so
relieved
to
at
least
understand
the
reason
and
to
realize
their
senseless
deaths
were
actually
serving
a
bigger
purpose
i
thanked
her
for
letting
me
know
