how
can
i
see
through
it
yes
if
you
wanted
to
be
disingenuous
and
irritating
then
its
a
challenge
i
pass
ok
so
what
you
mean
is
i
should
continue
humoring
your
leading
questions
until
you
happen
to
ask
certain
rhetorical
questions
that
contain
information
i
need
that
was
a
fact
and
then
a
period
with
a
crystal
ball
i
already
considered
that
i
dont
think
i
can
get
the
focus
of
the
ball
to
zoom
in
tight
enough
on
the
cue
balls
enclosure
to
read
the
answers
by
other
magical
means
i
guess
should
i
use
magic
magic
is
real
ive
been
using
it
use
whatever
word
you
want
to
describe
it
i
have
magic
wands
they
are
very
powerful
and
they
allow
me
to
be
magic
your
questions
are
silly
because
i
did
not
have
the
abilities
before
i
made
them
could
it
is
there
an
echo
i
dont
know
what
youre
getting
at
how
about
another
leading
question
some
stuff
im
guessing
this
is
one
of
the
rhetorical
questions
meant
to
be
informative
so
then
my
answer
should
affirm
how
ridiculous
that
sounds
shouldnt
it
that
wasnt
even
a
question
ok
magic
is
fake
the
wands
are
useless
toys
and
there
is
something
else
going
on
next
question
what
would
i
say
to
those
short
fables
not
much
except
i
gather
the
third
is
a
story
about
me
and
that
theres
a
lesson
youd
like
me
to
take
from
it
that
i
should
renounce
my
allegiance
before
my
grimdark
corruption
is
absolute
and
while
im
at
it
i
should
discard
these
useless
wands
because
apparently
the
power
was
in
my
little
black
heart
all
along
is
that
right
i
dont
know
if
you
say
so
yes
it
has
been
mysteriously
localized
to
my
middle
finger
could
the
dark
magics
be
at
work
again
friendship
isnt
an
emotion
numbnuts
ive
been
busy
ill
get
back
to
them
and
can
we
please
stop
doing
the
patronizing
question
thing
in
exchange
i
promise
i
will
discontinue
my
patronizing
responses
the
omniscipotent
can
do
whatever
they
please
i
guess
im
just
asking
you
nicely
to
do
me
this
favor
huh
so
creepy
yuck
ok
i
dont
know
with
her
eyes
i
dont
know
what
to
ask
anymore
im
confused
i
would
ask
what
should
i
do
next
what
should
i
do
next
