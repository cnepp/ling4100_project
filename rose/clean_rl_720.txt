corpse
party
of
course
i
would
describe
it
as
an
occasion
marked
by
a
great
deal
of
jubilation
at
the
expense
of
one
or
more
well
dressed
cadavers
well
in
my
experience
a
loved
one
typically
an
elder
arranges
to
have
the
departed
placed
in
a
small
box
and
then
forces
you
to
stand
in
the
rain
all
day
then
presumably
winded
by
all
the
deeply
ironic
catharsis
she
gets
drunk
and
passes
out
on
the
couch
im
going
to
agree
with
my
fellow
seer
on
this
