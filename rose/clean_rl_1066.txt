hello
yes
thats
right
more
specifically
youre
not
very
good
at
this
are
you
talking
to
people
its
ok
that
you
are
im
not
trying
to
criticize
ive
heard
some
things
about
you
that
pink
rocky
environment
back
there
thats
a
memory
of
your
home
right
you
renounced
the
throne
and
ran
away
to
the
moon
didnt
you
and
then
you
lived
there
completely
alone
for
how
many
years
i
think
im
starting
to
lose
track
of
what
a
year
is
myself
that
seems
to
be
what
happens
when
you
spend
enough
time
out
here
im
just
curious
about
you
you
seem
like
an
interesting
person
who
probably
has
a
lot
of
stories
to
tell
from
what
i
understand
you
discovered
something
on
the
moon
which
originally
contained
your
copy
of
the
game
is
that
true
maybe
we
could
spend
some
time
together
and
get
to
know
each
other
when
you
have
the
chance
of
course
hey
lord
english
yes
i
know
of
him
absolutely
but
later
we
cant
interrupt
the
plan
which
has
been
put
into
inexorable
motion
or
for
that
matter
the
meteor
were
traveling
on
which
has
been
similarly
propelled
we
have
to
rendezvous
with
our
rebooted
ancestors
as
it
were
and
help
them
win
their
game
in
the
process
we
will
ideally
become
stronger
and
more
experienced
only
then
will
we
be
ready
to
help
you
defeat
him
yes
but
even
if
i
agreed
i
couldnt
just
fly
away
with
you
now
im
not
even
standing
here
im
asleep
on
our
meteor
this
is
a
dream
projection
youre
talking
to
youre
new
to
dream
bubbles
arent
you
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
explain
to
you
how
they
work
in
extensive
detail
