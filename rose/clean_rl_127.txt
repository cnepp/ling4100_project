i
think
youre
shrewd
to
have
recognized
his
ploy
of
sabotage
and
youve
earned
my
compliments
what
is
whats
that
yes
but
you
said
it
wasnt
the
first
time
you
spoke
to
me
well
graciously
omit
my
embarrassing
skepticism
however
this
conversation
doesnt
sound
like
your
first
time
either
and
when
exactly
does
your
maiden
encounter
take
place
so
to
clarify
if
the
matching
of
my
first
with
your
second
is
denoted
by
then
the
sequence
would
be
why
is
it
that
when
the
subject
of
temporal
mechanics
is
broached
your
sparing
troll
intellects
etcetera
etcetera
you
mean
based
on
the
first
impression
i
am
apparently
about
to
make
in
our
next
conversation
what
could
i
possibly
say
that
will
leave
such
an
imprint
i
guess
being
forced
to
cooperate
with
a
stable
time
loop
is
the
only
plausible
explanation
for
my
remarks
and
what
if
my
countercounter
measure
is
to
choose
not
to
transcribe
this
dialogue
accurately
in
the
futurefirst
place
unless
i
decide
to
copy
it
wordforword
so
your
trolling
strategy
now
is
to
put
idiotic
words
in
my
mouth
through
the
machinery
of
temporal
inevitability
and
cause
me
to
excruciate
over
how
to
subvert
the
transcription
while
being
perfectly
up
front
about
it
ill
admit
its
a
more
advanced
tactic
than
i
gave
you
credit
for
mixed
metaphor
aside
usually
ninjas
dont
announce
what
theyre
doing
when
theyre
doing
it
like
when
stalking
an
emperor
to
assassinate
him
or
befriend
him
but
thats
fine
i
guess
the
only
pointless
question
we
havent
exhausted
is
why
why
the
convoluted
artifice
so
youre
not
only
rigging
the
first
impression
i
make
on
you
but
orchestrating
my
revenge
for
the
rigging
as
well
thats
an
interesting
take
on
it
but
now
i
know
for
sure
dave
isnt
behind
this
plan
its
too
complicated
youre
awfully
quick
to
his
defense
are
you
sure
you
dont
have
a
thing
for
him
its
ok
bro
you
can
admit
it
ok
im
going
to
talk
to
my
dead
cat
