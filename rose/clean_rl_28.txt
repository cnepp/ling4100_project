im
back
patience
you
still
havent
used
the
new
totem
i
believe
it
will
create
the
item
on
the
punch
card
well
see
ive
found
no
evidence
that
anyone
has
successfully
created
the
item
and
the
content
of
the
card
appears
to
be
variable
from
session
to
session
in
one
instance
it
was
described
as
an
eggy
loking
thign
sic
according
to
the
atheneum
it
is
a
free
item
this
speaks
to
its
importance
in
my
view
now
off
you
go
