yes
we
will
have
to
deal
with
jack
before
all
is
said
and
done
and
that
will
definitely
be
a
major
challenge
but
it
is
not
impossible
at
least
not
by
design
when
i
said
there
would
be
no
time
limit
in
this
session
i
was
talking
about
something
more
specific
there
will
be
no
reckoning
its
a
logical
consequence
of
any
void
session
the
battlefield
never
evolves
and
therefore
the
more
extensive
war
between
prospit
and
derse
never
takes
shape
it
is
only
when
the
prospitian
king
falls
in
battle
that
the
reckoning
can
be
initiated
by
the
forces
of
derse
the
meteors
then
rush
to
destroy
the
battlefield
while
skaia
redirects
them
through
defense
portals
for
as
long
as
it
can
thus
if
there
is
no
war
there
is
no
reckoning
no
meteors
and
no
imminent
threat
of
failure
this
is
of
course
good
news
for
earth
as
well
during
the
reckoning
skaia
redirects
all
incoming
meteors
to
the
only
place
it
can
earth
so
it
turns
out
that
players
who
initiate
a
void
session
are
not
actually
condemning
their
home
planet
to
an
apocalyptic
wasteland
after
they
leave
in
the
new
instance
of
our
universe
earth
is
just
fine
sort
of
again
sort
of
and
its
not
that
there
were
no
meteors
whatsoever
just
the
vast
majority
of
the
destructive
onslaught
never
showed
up
but
delivering
the
temple
to
the
site
of
the
forge
is
still
integral
to
jumpstarting
the
session
that
meteor
however
could
have
been
propelled
through
a
portal
by
any
means
not
just
via
the
reckoning
yes
but
they
werent
flung
through
portals
in
their
own
session
nor
will
they
be
created
there
they
were
created
in
our
session
and
sent
back
through
our
portals
just
like
us
