ga
haha
well
i
know
what
you
guys
look
like
ga
you
look
kind
of
like
ga
howie
mandel
from
little
monsters
ga
even
though
to
be
perfectly
frank
he
was
kind
of
a
big
monster
ga
because
he
was
a
big
goofy
adult
ga
and
fred
savage
was
like
his
child
prankster
sidekick
ga
no
its
a
movie
ga
you
should
ask
john
about
it
because
he
thinks
its
awesome
which
it
is
shes
not
here
right
now
shes
asleep
but
ok
see
you
and
then
i
proceed
to
make
this
brainless
remark
to
complement
my
many
others
or
do
i
umm
no
oh
yeah
thats
me
i
am
the
human
look
at
me
i
am
so
smart
with
all
these
snooty
words
and
complicated
things
to
say
i
am
the
queen
of
books
i
am
also
infuriatingly
aloof
and
difficult
to
engage
with
when
maybe
all
the
other
person
wants
to
do
is
maybe
to
try
to
be
my
friend
has
that
ever
occured
to
me
probably
not
fffuuhhhhhhhh
im
so
burned
these
burns
are
crazy
can
we
just
cut
to
the
chase
and
be
friends
already
these
cat
and
mouse
games
are
so
dumb
you
know
were
just
going
to
all
be
friends
at
some
point
anyway
i
dont
know
uh
maybe
its
hard
to
keep
track
with
all
your
time
nonsense
am
i
being
sincere
here
in
retrospect
it
will
probably
seem
unlikely
to
my
current
conversational
partner
thats
because
you
guys
always
do
things
the
hard
way
and
the
dumb
way
haha
well
i
know
what
you
guys
look
like
you
look
kind
of
like
howie
mandel
from
little
monsters
even
though
to
be
perfectly
frank
he
was
kind
of
a
big
monster
because
he
was
a
big
goofy
adult
and
fred
savage
was
like
his
child
prankster
sidekick
why
would
i
even
be
saying
things
like
this
of
course
i
have
been
so
foolish
it
is
because
i
am
trolling
you
i
wonder
where
i
could
have
possibly
gotten
the
idea
to
do
that
in
the
first
place
whoops
there
goes
my
human
sarcasm
again
it
is
like
a
regrettable
bodily
function
no
its
a
movie
you
should
ask
john
about
it
because
he
thinks
its
awesome
which
it
is
yeah
i
got
him
this
really
cool
bunny
for
his
birthday
and
its
really
nicely
knitted
and
everything
because
i
am
basically
in
love
with
him
you
are
right
it
is
at
this
point
i
admit
to
flushed
longings
for
the
ignoramus
who
likes
terrible
films
i
am
doing
this
only
to
bother
you
i
openly
acknowledge
this
here
specifically
to
improve
the
chances
that
we
will
develop
a
more
favorable
relationship
in
the
future
why
dont
you
talk
to
john
oh
man
i
dont
know
why
dont
you
pick
the
time
that
will
make
the
most
complicated
mess
out
of
everything
imaginable
you
know
thats
what
youre
gonna
do
anyway
i
said
smugly
ok
if
you
talk
to
him
in
the
past
hell
understand
even
less
buggywhipped
fuckall
about
time
and
hell
be
confused
so
maybe
paste
something
from
this
conversation
to
him
i
dont
know
and
if
you
talk
to
him
in
the
future
hell
probably
know
all
this
stuff
like
things
youve
said
to
him
but
havent
said
yet
and
then
youll
be
confused
sorry
thats
just
how
this
works
dont
say
i
didnt
warn
you
yeah
bye
heheheheheheh
the
last
thing
i
said
there
definitely
doesnt
make
any
sense
especially
given
the
context
i
now
have
for
authoring
the
remark
i
feel
really
stupid
for
having
typed
it
along
with
many
other
things
i
just
typed
