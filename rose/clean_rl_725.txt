nothing
yet
but
reasonably
soon
within
a
certain
window
it
will
be
time
to
leave
we
will
then
pilot
this
meteor
as
fast
as
we
can
make
it
go
in
that
exact
direction
nothing
whatsoever
as
of
now
that
way
lies
darkness
and
uncertainty
beyond
description
trust
me
it
is
just
as
you
should
trust
me
that
by
the
time
we
leave
if
we
leave
exactly
within
the
designated
window
and
are
able
to
travel
at
nearly
the
speed
of
light
the
meteor
will
trace
a
route
through
the
furthest
ring
which
will
topologically
resolve
as
a
straight
line
it
will
lead
us
directly
to
the
new
session
for
a
brief
moment
the
sun
will
be
visible
from
that
session
and
we
will
be
riding
the
chartreuse
coattails
of
its
photons
thats
because
its
almost
impossible
to
do
so
voluntarily
if
we
were
to
head
right
now
in
the
sessions
true
physical
direction
it
wouldnt
be
long
before
we
found
ourselves
traveling
in
just
the
opposite
direction
this
is
not
even
to
speak
of
the
chronological
peculiarities
after
traveling
some
distance
we
could
discover
we
were
suddenly
tailgating
our
own
meteor
from
several
days
ago
if
we
are
particularly
unfortunate
we
might
even
collide
in
an
intersection
of
spacetime
with
a
meteor
piloted
by
our
future
selves
and
if
we
looked
closely
at
that
meteor
before
impact
we
might
notice
a
very
large
dent
in
it
which
it
originally
suffered
during
the
very
collision
we
were
about
to
experience
it
takes
precision
and
timing
to
reach
your
destination
out
here
and
most
importantly
the
grace
of
the
gods
themselves
hm
yes
yes
dont
be
ridiculous
it
wont
take
nearly
that
long
itll
only
take
about
three
years
yes
two
and
then
fifty
more
