sweet
catch
i
cant
interact
with
you
directly
or
anything
that
you
are
touching
if
it
will
result
in
moving
you
see
the
game
probably
regards
that
as
a
kind
of
cheating
in
a
way
thieving
you
of
your
free
will
as
an
adventurer
and
the
need
to
advance
by
your
own
skill
and
ingenuity
the
server
player
is
just
a
facilitator
no
you
should
pick
up
your
hammer
and
defend
yourself
i
have
no
idea
what
the
hell
dave
is
up
to
or
if
hes
any
closer
to
recovering
the
game
theres
some
stuff
id
like
to
try
in
case
he
doesnt
come
through
