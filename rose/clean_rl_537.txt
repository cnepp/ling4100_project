i
should
have
gone
looking
for
her
why
didnt
i
john
was
too
but
he
went
to
look
for
his
father
it
would
have
been
normal
of
me
i
cant
remember
what
i
was
trying
to
prove
anymore
youre
doing
fine
for
someone
raised
by
a
dog
or
really
anyone
thanks
for
some
reason
despite
all
the
danger
i
never
thought
she
was
in
any
trouble
i
never
believed
she
would
actually
die
i
grew
up
with
the
feeling
that
something
more
significant
had
always
been
meant
for
her
that
she
was
a
heroine
displaced
in
some
way
resigned
to
the
inglorious
duty
of
raising
me
and
preparing
me
in
her
way
i
didnt
actually
need
the
ectobiological
verification
that
she
was
like
a
mother
and
a
sister
at
the
same
time
i
always
understood
that
somehow
and
i
felt
she
had
knowledge
and
ability
beyond
what
she
let
on
it
was
always
intimidating
but
nonetheless
a
source
of
respect
which
was
childishly
begrudging
on
my
part
i
think
she
was
just
waiting
for
me
to
catch
up
with
her
but
now
i
cant
probably
because
my
emotions
have
now
ceded
to
anger
this
shouldnt
have
happened
i
already
was
i
was
going
to
go
to
sleep
fly
to
a
sun
bigger
than
our
universe
drop
a
bomb
in
it
and
kill
myself
so
if
my
course
of
action
is
to
change
on
account
of
my
mood
it
can
only
become
less
impetuous
dont
you
think
you
never
liked
my
plan
very
much
anyway
im
not
sure
if
i
did
maybe
it
was
a
terrible
plan
i
made
it
without
a
full
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
scratch
i
could
stop
being
so
cowardly
for
once
i
could
short
circuit
this
endlessly
expanding
game
of
chess
were
playing
just
like
jack
decided
to
do
maybe
i
will
go
kill
jack
myself
right
now
probably
but
the
scratch
will
wipe
us
out
anyway
and
reboot
the
conditions
of
our
session
i
suddenly
dont
feel
much
like
sneaking
through
the
back
door
of
the
furthest
ring
for
retribution
by
distant
super
nova
whether
my
existing
plan
was
sensible
or
not
i
may
have
been
allowing
myself
to
be
manipulated
by
an
omniscient
being
regardless
this
is
a
private
conversation
private
even
to
those
who
know
it
word
for
word
already
ignore
him
shh
anyway
if
its
true
the
gods
have
selected
me
for
service
maybe
the
power
theyve
given
me
will
be
sufficient
maybe
they
wanted
me
to
kill
him
all
along
but
i
am
im
fully
aware
ill
probably
die
and
fail
scratch
happens
we
start
fresh
no
recollection
no
problem
they
are
enormous
ugly
and
live
in
darkness
that
doesnt
necessarily
make
them
bad
the
cue
ball
yes
and
he
is
right
it
advised
me
to
talk
to
you
just
now
so
i
guess
so
what
are
you
suggesting
i
ask
it
so
youre
saying
i
should
ask
it
if
the
gods
are
evil
