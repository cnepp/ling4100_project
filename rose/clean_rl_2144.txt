my
brand
missed
you
too
john
theyre
probably
getting
a
stern
earful
of
roiling
monster
patois
right
about
now
at
what
i
think
karkat
will
successfully
fail
to
understand
the
monster
and
possibly
also
successfully
shout
at
the
monster
kanaya
i
think
will
probably
successfully
do
something
sensible
in
response
to
whatever
the
monster
demands
im
still
not
sure
what
it
is
but
yes
you
think
so
vriska
says
a
lot
of
things
thats
the
basic
idea
yes
but
monsters
can
be
complicated
regardless
i
think
the
right
person
was
summoned
to
handle
it
sure
you
do
i
am
too
when
you
put
it
that
way
it
really
does
sound
like
you
were
trying
to
fuck
us
up
