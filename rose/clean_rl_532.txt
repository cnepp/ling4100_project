fine
then
please
at
least
try
to
sound
more
sarcastic
when
you
do
it
then
the
scratch
will
be
implemented
later
by
either
john
or
dave
i
presume
you
used
a
male
pronoun
i
guess
it
makes
sense
that
it
would
happen
later
my
understanding
is
that
jack
will
not
be
banished
from
this
session
until
near
the
end
of
the
reckoning
i
dont
understand
i
thought
that
was
the
point
of
the
scratch
to
open
a
rift
in
spacetime
as
it
were
and
banish
him
into
the
trolls
session
hmm
then
why
have
you
directed
me
to
cause
it
does
it
have
something
to
do
with
enabling
you
to
die
i
think
its
disingenuous
for
you
to
behave
as
if
i
have
not
been
misled
you
say
you
dont
lie
but
what
about
lies
of
omission
unless
youre
joking
haa
haa
hee
hee
hoo
hoo
then
i
guess
ill
start
asking
better
questions
will
you
ok
noted
what
exactly
does
the
scratch
do
then
oh
thats
it
then
we
all
start
from
the
beginning
again
when
john
entered
what
will
happen
to
us
everyone
in
this
session
now
this
seems
familiar
it
reminds
me
of
when
dave
and
i
were
trapped
in
the
doomed
timeline
and
he
left
to
change
the
past
the
timeline
ceased
to
exist
along
with
my
dream
self
who
in
a
way
became
merged
with
my
dream
self
of
this
timeline
i
kept
some
of
her
memories
is
the
situation
similar
