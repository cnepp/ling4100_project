research
were
trying
to
put
all
the
pieces
of
the
puzzle
together
you
are
aware
this
meteor
has
many
secret
rooms
scattered
throughout
including
libraries
right
can
town
no
wow
what
a
story
primarily
to
gain
a
more
thorough
understanding
of
the
situation
well
be
entering
when
we
arrive
oh
my
god
ive
told
you
i
cant
see
the
future
ok
but
not
all
of
it
only
certain
relevant
pieces
its
a
bit
frustrating
when
people
make
that
presumption
about
you
for
instance
you
are
a
knight
of
time
since
you
have
such
mastery
over
time
doesnt
that
mean
you
should
know
everything
about
the
future
too
right
so
there
are
significant
limitations
on
what
you
can
know
governed
by
certain
rules
thats
how
it
is
for
a
seer
too
but
i
will
say
that
i
have
been
able
to
use
these
abilities
to
assist
with
research
i
can
treat
my
finite
glimpses
as
an
additional
source
of
information
if
you
combine
that
with
the
knowledge
weve
gathered
from
these
texts
and
things
weve
learned
from
our
various
encounters
with
the
deceased
with
a
bit
of
inference
and
deduction
a
more
detailed
picture
is
coming
into
focus
do
you
want
to
hear
about
it
yes
why
not
its
been
a
year
it
seems
like
all
weve
done
on
this
trip
so
far
is
indulge
in
lavish
interior
decoration
projects
and
screw
around
with
mysterious
can
town
initiatives
which
may
or
may
not
be
consuming
valuable
library
resources
as
building
materials
we
could
make
at
least
some
effort
to
squeeze
in
annual
briefings
on
our
objective
i
think
youll
find
that
when
it
comes
to
striving
for
a
reasonable
approximation
of
legitimacy
we
are
simply
the
most
barely
adequate
there
is
um
sure
