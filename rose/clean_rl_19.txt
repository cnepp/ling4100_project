sorry
i
keep
losing
the
wireless
signal
must
be
the
weather
i
would
look
for
a
stronger
signal
in
another
part
of
the
house
but
id
rather
not
risk
an
encounter
with
my
mother
i
battled
through
her
cloud
of
gin
and
derision
once
already
this
evening
yes
cake
jesters
unfaltering
love
and
support
quite
a
road
to
hoe
there
though
i
suppose
im
complicit
for
not
informing
social
services
about
your
situation
that
presents
the
same
problem
also
its
raining
remember
and
dark
yes
the
sun
has
already
had
its
way
with
us
here
on
the
east
coast
its
lurid
glare
has
moved
on
to
younger
timezones
