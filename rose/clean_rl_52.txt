hello
and
thanks
i
just
opened
it
this
very
moment
what
a
stunning
coincidence
you
would
ask
about
it
now
i
am
stunned
and
who
said
it
was
something
from
which
something
else
could
be
made
i
suppose
ill
take
a
stab
at
learning
the
craft
its
the
least
i
can
do
in
response
to
the
subtle
dig
concealed
in
his
gesture
he
often
tells
me
i
need
a
new
hobby
when
i
make
perfectly
reasonable
analytical
remarks
maybe
his
birthday
is
in
a
few
months
isnt
it
years
its
so
hard
to
tell
when
youre
joking
or
if
youre
even
capable
of
it
ill
probably
craft
something
with
strong
sentimental
value
that
should
burn
him
i
guess
not
so
shall
i
expect
a
green
package
dropped
to
my
house
via
airmail
from
whatever
screwball
cranny
of
the
globe
youre
tucked
into
oh
this
is
already
intriguing
enough
to
compensate
for
the
grave
scarcity
of
lavish
gifts
parachuting
from
the
sky
please
go
on
yes
ok
well
i
didnt
mention
it
was
a
cat
or
that
it
was
a
male
lets
pretend
im
surprised
and
youre
embarrassed
and
move
on
to
answer
your
question
i
would
describe
my
feelings
toward
the
animal
as
lukewarm
if
someone
told
me
that
i
would
regard
the
remark
with
a
great
deal
of
skepticism
if
that
someone
was
you
on
the
other
hand
then
i
would
have
to
ask
preemptively
is
that
someone
you
so
what
is
this
game
ill
see
what
the
word
on
the
street
is
about
it
in
due
time
for
now
i
should
probably
order
a
copy
of
knitting
for
assholes
it
would
be
a
shame
if
i
ran
late
with
johns
present
