well
you
died
too
yes
while
pushing
me
out
of
the
way
of
a
fork
so
thank
you
for
that
retroactively
and
to
a
different
version
of
you
yeah
we
didnt
get
to
exchange
even
a
single
word
before
you
were
gone
all
i
could
think
was
how
can
this
be
happening
again
luckily
the
sense
of
misery
was
short
lived
though
it
wasnt
long
before
i
was
informed
the
incident
was
part
of
something
bigger
taking
shape
and
that
john
was
on
his
way
with
a
different
version
of
you
i
had
no
idea
what
a
different
version
actually
entailed
but
i
wasnt
about
to
quibble
i
was
so
relieved
you
did
a
funeral
wow
that
sorry
for
this
if
it
comes
off
as
odd
but
that
is
so
mom
of
you
mhm
me
too
