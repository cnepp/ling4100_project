im
not
this
book
contains
a
genetic
code
the
gods
from
the
furthest
ring
asked
me
to
how
did
you
know
i
wrote
a
story
about
wizards
anyway
this
story
sounds
suspicious
no
i
dont
actually
mind
too
bad
i
missed
him
i
like
wizards
what
i
dont
like
is
my
mothers
obsession
with
feigning
interest
in
them
to
antagonize
me
no
i
told
you
its
one
of
the
gene
sequences
locked
in
my
subconcious
the
gods
say
its
critical
to
destroy
it
when
i
was
asleep
yes
when
i
flew
to
your
tower
i
heard
them
theyre
far
above
in
the
dark
sky
arent
you
often
distracted
by
music
and
puppets
have
you
ever
looked
into
the
sky
without
your
shades
maybe
you
should
try
it
some
time
youre
the
prince
of
the
moon
im
sure
theyve
been
meaning
to
seek
a
royal
audience
what
do
all
these
dots
mean
