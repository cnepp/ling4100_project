no
its
something
like
an
extensive
journal
im
recording
everything
weve
been
through
so
far
and
detailed
notes
on
everything
we
know
about
the
game
im
also
using
it
to
document
our
research
and
extrapolate
on
the
new
session
and
players
somewhat
i
dont
look
at
it
that
way
im
approaching
it
from
a
standpoint
of
responsible
historical
documentation
dont
you
think
people
in
the
future
will
want
to
know
about
our
story
i
think
it
could
be
a
very
useful
resource
some
day
it
could
be
helpful
to
others
beginning
their
own
quests
from
what
i
understand
everything
already
has
gone
wrong
before
the
game
even
started
in
many
different
ways
than
ours
did
there
are
indications
of
thicker
political
intrigue
assassination
attempts
and
a
usurpation
of
the
throne
more
insidious
than
what
we
dealt
with
but
those
examples
still
dont
illustrate
the
fundamental
fault
with
their
session
ours
had
a
similar
fault
it
was
a
null
session
literature
on
the
subject
says
null
sessions
are
actually
very
common
it
is
any
session
resulting
in
failure
and
as
such
designed
to
result
in
failure
from
the
start
due
to
skaias
comprehensive
knowledge
of
its
own
fate
and
that
of
all
it
illumines
biologically
speaking
its
to
be
expected
that
null
sessions
far
outnumber
the
successful
ones
when
it
comes
to
reproductive
systems
overwhelming
redundancy
is
commonplace
a
universe
has
a
reproductive
system
that
spreads
many
seeds
as
it
were
most
of
which
never
come
to
fruition
so
we
shouldnt
feel
too
bad
about
our
results
really
it
was
quite
par
for
the
course
but
then
it
would
also
seem
that
exceedingly
few
null
sessions
result
in
the
birth
of
a
massive
green
star
fueled
by
two
dead
universes
for
what
its
worth
well
yes
theres
more
to
it
though
the
new
session
is
essentially
our
session
rebooted
with
different
parameters
which
also
affected
the
original
conditions
of
our
universe
and
strangely
it
seems
the
new
one
is
a
null
session
as
well
but
within
a
much
less
common
subset
of
all
null
sessions
this
one
is
referred
to
as
a
void
session
