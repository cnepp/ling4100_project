i
imagine
its
a
lot
easier
to
relax
when
another
version
of
yourself
hasnt
been
hijacked
by
your
dead
cat
sounds
suspiciously
like
the
advice
of
someone
whos
never
had
to
deal
with
an
outlandish
alternate
version
of
himself
you
mean
johns
that
were
essentially
time
duplicates
in
the
course
of
your
retcon
quest
those
dont
count
those
were
just
regular
johns
what
im
saying
is
you
never
had
to
deal
with
the
john
who
was
like
half
harry
anderson
and
half
maplehoof
the
dear
departed
pony
come
to
think
of
it
youre
the
only
one
of
us
who
hasnt
i
mean
of
our
original
group
of
friends
dave
had
bird
dave
jade
had
dog
jade
and
now
i
have
shudder
cat
why
were
you
let
off
the
hook
even
putting
aside
the
wildly
unwelcome
body
horror
slapstick
routine
she
represents
and
the
machine
gun
salvo
of
opprobrious
remarks
and
conduct
which
my
cat
is
apparently
capable
of
releasing
from
my
subconscious
im
not
sure
where
this
leaves
me
i
felt
like
i
understood
my
place
id
gotten
myself
in
order
somewhat
my
um
beverage
decisions
had
gotten
more
reasonable
i
was
ready
to
bear
down
and
play
my
part
in
finishing
this
i
could
even
handle
a
stray
rosesprite
brought
to
my
doorstep
by
my
sweet
imbecile
of
a
pet
idiotic
though
that
was
i
was
still
clearly
prime
but
can
i
really
claim
that
now
shes
a
sprite
squared
how
is
that
even
a
thing
can
someone
tell
me
how
thats
even
a
thing
whats
next
is
there
a
sprite
cubed
or
a
lets
not
even
entertain
this
avenue
of
thought
the
point
is
she
must
be
quite
powerful
insightful
and
in
spite
of
the
beast
she
rents
headspace
out
to
intelligent
as
well
doesnt
she
arguably
have
more
claim
to
being
real
than
i
do
i
dont
care
if
my
feelings
are
hurt
though
i
just
want
to
know
where
i
stand
sure
thats
what
she
wants
you
to
think
that
was
a
different
context
i
probably
would
have
felt
the
same
way
if
i
found
myself
in
her
exact
situation
jasprose
changes
everything
though
now
i
feel
a
certain
responsibility
like
i
have
to
really
step
up
yes
to
make
sure
i
stay
regarded
as
the
exemplary
model
to
provide
assurance
that
the
concept
of
roseness
itself
doesnt
degrade
due
to
black
market
peddlers
of
substandard
shit
basically
i
need
to
defend
the
integrity
of
the
brand
what
