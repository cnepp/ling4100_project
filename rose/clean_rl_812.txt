instead
it
remains
in
its
most
basic
form
stuck
in
eternal
stalemate
there
is
nothing
players
in
a
void
session
can
do
to
change
this
they
are
resigned
to
live
out
the
rest
of
their
days
in
a
dead
end
session
its
a
vast
improvement
the
new
session
is
a
blank
slate
without
a
ridiculously
short
time
limit
for
victory
like
ours
had
there
will
be
no
time
limit
at
all
in
fact
once
we
arrive
ostensibly
that
is
when
the
nature
of
the
session
will
change
it
wont
be
classifiable
as
either
a
null
or
void
session
anymore
it
will
be
something
which
as
far
as
i
can
tell
is
unique
the
fully
matured
battlefield
from
our
session
can
be
used
to
make
the
new
one
viable
the
path
to
success
will
be
made
possible
by
a
combination
of
efforts
and
assets
from
both
iterations
usually
scratched
sessions
are
absolute
resets
and
involve
no
direct
influence
from
the
first
attempt
at
all
i
cant
find
any
precedent
for
our
situation
yes
pretty
much
as
long
as
there
is
an
actual
vacancy
in
the
center
of
skaia
when
we
get
there
