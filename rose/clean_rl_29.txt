john
are
you
there
i
know
ive
been
watching
you
scramble
through
the
house
like
a
lunatic
you
should
have
answered
me
sooner
no
im
sure
hell
turn
up
we
have
more
important
things
to
address
right
now
i
dont
know
that
either
but
ive
determined
your
neighborhood
was
destroyed
by
the
meteor
wherever
you
were
transported
it
saved
you
from
the
impact
ive
been
reading
reports
in
the
news
over
the
last
few
days
there
have
been
many
smaller
meteor
collisions
with
peoples
homes
around
the
world
and
they
seem
to
be
getting
bigger
yours
was
the
biggest
theyve
identified
so
far
perhaps
yes
but
wait
we
should
retrieve
your
pda
yet
again
it
will
help
to
keep
tabs
on
each
other
while
you
investigate
i
think
i
can
get
you
closer
to
it
if
i
can
replenish
our
grist
supply
somewhat
there
may
be
a
way
to
recycle
some
that
we
already
used
ill
meet
you
out
on
the
balcony
what
i
was
working
on
something
to
send
you
but
i
was
running
late
with
it
i
didnt
want
you
to
think
i
believed
meager
well
wishes
alone
would
suffice
for
the
occasion
that
said
happy
birthday
john
