im
trying
to
spread
the
upward
construction
around
so
there
is
a
more
substantial
foundation
for
later
on
but
im
starting
to
wonder
if
it
will
be
strong
enough
its
kind
of
starting
to
wobble
a
little
i
dont
think
brick
chimneys
were
meant
to
serve
this
architectural
purpose
i
might
have
to
adopt
a
different
building
strategy
stick
to
more
loadbearing
walls
and
blockier
shapes
especially
since
grist
has
been
easier
to
come
by
lately
right
