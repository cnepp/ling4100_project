theyve
revealed
some
of
their
secrets
to
me
already
and
given
me
a
few
errands
to
run
this
is
why
you
might
have
observed
some
unusual
behavior
from
me
once
these
convulsions
of
explosive
laughter
subside
and
finish
rocking
my
very
foundation
i
might
point
out
that
you
havent
really
been
as
astute
as
youre
implying
youve
deliberately
fogged
your
vision
your
entire
life
with
ironic
eyewear
while
awake
and
while
asleep
though
perfectly
alert
youve
chosen
to
ignore
your
surroundings
but
now
that
youve
seen
them
you
have
a
choice
to
make
they
will
only
tell
me
so
much
they
would
like
an
audience
with
the
prince
of
the
moon
as
well
we
are
like
the
emissaries
to
what
lies
beyond
this
small
bubble
in
their
unfathomable
dark
foam
derse
skirts
its
edge
and
during
the
lunar
eclipse
we
graze
it
and
thats
when
their
intent
for
us
becomes
clear
im
doing
my
part
but
they
have
a
mission
for
you
as
well
listen
to
them
my
understanding
is
they
will
teach
you
how
to
navigate
the
unnavigable
the
result
should
be
a
map
no
something
a
little
more
astronomical
like
a
star
chart
with
no
stars
hence
the
challenge
to
plot
a
course
through
the
furthest
ring
