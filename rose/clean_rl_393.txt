the
power
source
of
the
first
guardians
yes
thats
much
better
whats
the
deal
with
it
i
dont
know
that
there
is
a
deal
with
it
beyond
the
deal
you
just
described
it
is
what
it
sounds
like
a
huge
sun
out
in
the
literal
middle
of
nowhere
and
it
is
bright
green
it
is
simply
the
green
sun
it
is
nearly
twice
the
mass
of
our
universe
happy
i
could
help
yes
no
the
geometry
of
the
furthest
ring
is
too
complex
remember
its
spacetime
is
labyrinthine
in
fact
its
not
really
accurate
to
call
it
spacetime
at
all
since
it
is
outside
the
domain
of
any
created
universe
where
those
properties
have
become
instantiated
and
stabilized
it
depends
the
greater
the
distance
you
travel
through
it
the
less
reliably
time
flows
and
the
more
time
you
spend
in
it
the
less
reliably
space
behaves
time
and
space
arent
as
different
as
you
might
think
i
think
it
means
im
supposed
to
know
shit
about
the
big
picture
which
includes
tidbits
like
that
but
the
insides
of
my
shoes
stay
free
from
the
grit
of
the
minutia
no
i
do
that
depends
on
if
john
is
successful
