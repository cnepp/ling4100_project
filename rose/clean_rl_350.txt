john
you
were
sleeping
why
were
you
sleeping
everywhere
i
look
i
see
boys
taking
naps
you
werent
ten
minutes
id
say
what
were
you
dreaming
about
i
wouldnt
imagine
so
a
black
guy
thanks
for
clearing
that
up
shes
fine
but
youre
not
remember
how
i
said
your
planet
was
on
fire
it
did
not
do
you
see
that
pinkish
hue
behind
you
bleeding
over
the
horizon
i
dont
think
the
fires
rate
of
propagation
is
quite
as
fast
as
youre
imagining
but
the
danger
is
still
significant
especially
considering
that
your
bed
is
sinking
relax
look
to
your
right
