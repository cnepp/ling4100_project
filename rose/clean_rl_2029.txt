dave
we
were
sort
of
in
the
middle
of
something
here
a
series
of
heartfelt
conversations
of
a
personal
nature
one
cannot
simply
be
boned
up
on
shit
such
as
this
you
had
to
be
there
wizards
problems
feelings
it
was
your
standard
tale
of
two
estranged
mutual
mothers
any
questions
ok
can
you
maybe
sit
over
there
for
a
while
and
write
them
all
down
utterly
destroyed
again
by
her
superior
sense
of
reason
and
decorum
though
i
do
wonder
if
her
perspective
would
be
different
if
shed
ever
had
to
manage
relations
with
a
twin
brother
it
would
probably
get
a
little
weird
dave
dave
sigh
dave
im
perfectly
happy
serving
as
a
spectator
and
occasional
officiator
of
this
conversation
its
quite
entertaining
to
behold
really
i
love
watching
how
different
personalities
collide
with
each
other
upon
meeting
neither
of
you
is
failing
to
disappoint
