this
will
at
least
buy
you
some
time
if
you
stay
calm
and
we
work
together
we
can
get
you
out
of
this
im
practically
an
expert
at
escaping
fires
by
now
yes
i
have
a
crystal
ball
yes
i
think
so
no
it
can
only
show
me
various
locations
in
the
present
moment
as
far
as
i
can
tell
my
perception
of
the
future
has
been
informed
by
other
sources
informants
whispering
gods
memories
sifted
from
dreams
cryptic
readings
from
unearthed
talismans
conclusions
drawn
from
riddles
deciphered
every
gambit
youd
expect
a
quest
to
extend
to
an
emerging
seer
just
as
i
presume
an
heir
would
be
supplied
with
whats
needed
for
his
maturation
assuming
hes
looking
for
it
you
should
probably
be
doing
what
youre
doing
i
didnt
know
why
you
were
asleep
did
i
i
have
more
pedestrian
sources
too
you
know
sometimes
trolls
blither
tidbits
about
the
future
and
i
cant
help
but
take
note
of
it
just
as
they
do
with
you
you
also
have
access
to
the
oracle
clouds
in
skaia
whereas
i
do
not
knowing
the
future
is
no
remarkable
feat
here
it
appears
to
be
a
fact
of
life
im
not
all
that
special
john
really
im
not
actually
trying
to
caricaturize
a
grim
sorcerer
theres
still
a
perfectly
intact
piece
of
my
mind
which
realizes
how
ridiculous
it
is
to
be
flying
across
rainbow
oceans
with
a
couple
of
magic
wands
and
a
salamander
in
a
little
cowl
and
it
wasnt
without
swallowing
a
little
embarrassment
that
i
revealed
i
was
using
a
crystal
ball
just
now
its
all
pretty
absurd
and
yet
its
been
fun
and
above
all
practical
for
solving
our
problems
i
still
read
books
and
tell
jokes
john
that
was
mean
