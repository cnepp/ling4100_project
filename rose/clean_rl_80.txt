good
work
john
for
now
ill
have
to
leave
again
shortly
it
looks
like
theres
another
large
meteor
headed
for
my
present
location
not
yet
ill
explain
later
but
i
think
ive
determined
that
activating
the
timer
in
the
game
is
not
directly
responsible
for
summoning
a
meteor
to
your
location
the
countdown
seems
merely
to
exist
as
a
kind
of
warning
to
the
player
as
well
as
a
strange
coincidence
probably
not
at
the
moment
and
certainly
not
to
you
i
have
to
go
p
s
try
not
to
waste
too
much
of
that
grist
while
im
gone
