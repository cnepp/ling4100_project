that
all
you
have
to
say

thought
you
were
supposed
to
be
more
helpful
after
your
resurrection
like
a
ghostly
spirit
guide
wise
if
frustratingly
cryptic
actually
cryptic
behavior
would
be
welcome

this
point

inane

i
report
to
the
others

kernelsprite

take
some
screen

the
way

might
be
some
tuna
in
the
cabinets

message
you
gave
me
years
ago
before
you
disappeared

you
mean

some
meaning
to
these
responses
or
are
you
just
being
obstinate

i
asleep

of
it
sounds
like
you
arent
exactly
in
complete
command
of
this
information
