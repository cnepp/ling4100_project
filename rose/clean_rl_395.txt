it
is
set
to
detonate
precisely
when
the
reckoning
ends
this
is
how
long
we
have
to
put
this
plan
into
motion
it
could
be
a
feature
of
any
session
not
meant
to
bear
fruit
a
means
to
wipe
out
a
null
session
rather
than
leaving
it
lingering
in
paradox
space
for
eternity
or
it
could
be
a
mutation
specific
to
our
session
i
really
dont
know
not
exactly
theyve
urged
me
in
certain
directions
and
guided
my
exploration
ive
obtained
some
answers
from
them
but
ultimately
this
idea
is
mine
plus
i
have
other
sources
one
in
particular
has
been
quite
illuminating
ive
been
referring
to
him
as
an
informant
when
people
ask
which
isnt
often
no
its
a
man
who
exists
in
another
universe
he
wants
to
die
only
as
credible
as
the
omniscient
tend
to
be
yeah
i
think
thats
what
omniscient
means
but
maybe
ill
ask
him
about
that
since
hes
the
omniscient
one
he
says
he
doesnt
lie
for
some
reason
i
believe
him
about
that
hes
a
convincing
fellow
he
no
longer
has
a
purpose
now
that
hes
done
everything
required
to
summon
his
master
as
a
first
guardian
hes
completely
indestructible
well
almost
completely
his
power
is
derived
from
the
same
source
as
earths
guardian
and
conveniently
that
of
our
nemesis
as
well
when
john
delivers
the
tumor
and
i
do
mean
the
tumor
i
and
i
alone
will
navigate
the
furthest
ring
and
i
will
destroy
the
sun
by
which
i
do
mean
the
green
mother
fucking
sun
and
in
case
it
wasnt
clear
i
wont
be
coming
back
and
i
will
destroy
the
sun
by
which
i
do
mean
the
green
motherfucking
sun
and
in
case
it
wasnt
clear
i
wont
be
coming
back
