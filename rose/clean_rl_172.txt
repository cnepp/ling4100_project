pardon
im
a
little
busy
that
sounds
about
right
honestly
i
was
looking
forward
to
playing
along
and
reading
your
dumb
script
for
our
next
conversation
but
it
turned
out
there
was
a
perfectly
logical
explanation
for
it
all
imagine
my
disappointment
while
i
imagine
yours
once
you
finally
catch
on
id
love
to
explain
in
detail
and
cause
some
sort
of
time
paradox
but
you
see
and
this
revelation
may
be
as
startling
as
any
im
a
little
busy
yes
that
is
definitely
a
conclusion
you
have
just
now
drawn
the
only
thing
left
to
do
is
ride
out
the
next
several
conversations
while
you
maintain
that
understanding
and
while
i
maintain
the
chilly
facade
you
have
grown
to
so
enjoy
from
smart
which
shouldnt
be
too
difficult
because
have
i
mentioned
im
busy
goodbye
