i
guess
one
could
use
those
words
to
describe
it
if
armed
with
a
predilection
for
the
inapt
eerily
iridescent
i
certainly
dont
see
any
oily
rivers
theres
an
ocean
though
yes
one
of
them
is
bugging
me
now
i
thought
it
was
odd
timing
color
my
curiosity
piqued
i
guess
eventually
pardon
the
envy
im
about
to
vent
in
your
direction
for
finding
yourself
at
the
mercy
of
a
rational
orchestrator
you
dont
feel
weird
when
i
watch
you
i
cant
see
you
now
for
what
its
worth
ok
bye
john
