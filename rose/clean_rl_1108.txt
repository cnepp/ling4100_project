what
happened
youre
not
glowing
anymore
oh
so
you
did
go
talk
to
her
thats
great
how
did
it
go
i
knew
you
wouldnt
regret
it
if
you
got
up
the
nerve
to
talk
to
her
what
did
she
say
besides
a
few
vampiretovampire
skindimming
pointers
oh
then
you
want
to
try
to
restore
your
race
again
i
had
begun
to
think
youd
lost
hope
in
that
possibility
thats
true
i
can
tell
we
can
work
on
it
together
when
we
arrive
maybe
the
session
were
about
to
explore
will
offer
some
answers
hey
you
arent
permanently
deglowed
now
are
you
oh
good
you
had
me
worried
there
for
a
moment
light
is
one
of
my
favorite
things
please
dont
take
these
as
fighting
words
but
my
aspect
is
simply
the
best
there
is
just
a
little
alchemy
no
believe
it
or
not
im
actually
focused
the
contents
of
the
bottles
the
alchemy
im
practicing
is
a
little
more
old
fashioned
you
know
there
was
a
time
on
earth
when
alchemy
didnt
refer
to
a
process
whereby
a
large
device
used
game
constructs
to
materialize
some
idealized
version
of
an
object
out
of
thin
air
alchemists
used
to
experiment
with
various
substances
to
transmute
them
into
something
more
valuable
its
more
pedestrian
and
scientifically
credible
cousin
would
be
chemistry
which
i
guess
is
the
technical
term
for
mixing
shit
together
which
strictly
speaking
more
accurately
describes
what
im
doing
thanks
for
the
imagery
it
was
almost
as
graphic
as
it
made
no
sense
beverages
tasty
beverages
i
hope
ill
see
what
i
can
do
you
better
not
let
kanaya
find
you
in
here
she
still
hates
you
you
know
and
not
in
that
way
i
think
she
still
truly
would
like
to
kill
you
ive
wondered
doesnt
it
ever
get
confusing
trying
to
differentiate
between
platonic
malicious
intent
and
gestures
of
black
romance
wait
really
who
karkat
dave
not
the
mayor
wait
terezi
are
you
serious
i
i
cant
even
parse
that
relationship
as
something
meaningful
what
this
is
a
really
startling
revelation
i
must
say
its
a
game
changer
yes
i
can
see
the
dilemma
youre
in
your
social
dynamics
really
begin
to
get
complicated
once
your
quadrants
start
to
fill
up
dont
they
dont
worry
your
secret
is
safe
with
me
now
shoo
back
into
the
ventilation
system
with
you
before
youre
spotted
seems
shes
passing
through
kanaya
doesnt
want
her
to
cause
trouble
feel
free
to
take
it
up
with
kanaya
but
if
you
authorize
her
to
flip
a
bitch
just
make
sure
shes
nowhere
near
my
chemistry
table
dork
i
know
ive
been
in
the
same
room
right
over
there
listening
to
you
mumble
lyrics
to
yourself
for
the
last
couple
hours
yes
to
which
sucky
thing
are
you
referring
is
this
about
terezi
fine
here
i
am
you
just
have
a
tendency
to
go
on
for
a
while
i
assumed
we
progressed
to
the
traditional
mumbling
monologue
stage
of
striderian
discourse
take
on
what
oh
i
saw
him
the
other
night
in
a
dream
it
was
very
brief
only
a
few
minutes
i
waved
to
him
and
then
woke
up
he
was
fighting
jack
actually
he
was
doing
quite
well
i
will
later
though
id
like
to
get
back
to
work
i
have
plans
tonight
how
about
tomorrow
just
some
plans
no
not
to
harp
on
the
issue
but
now
that
you
can
switch
on
and
off
so
to
speak
how
often
do
you
think
youll
resort
to
phosphorescence
well
which
state
is
more
comfortable
makes
sense
was
this
a
biological
feature
common
to
other
trolls
im
sorry
im
really
pestering
you
about
this
arent
i
weve
never
talked
about
it
i
guess
i
was
trying
to
be
polite
but
ive
been
really
curious
about
it
maybe
to
frighten
predators
away
from
innocent
grubs
ill
agree
with
that
assessment
on
the
grounds
that
ive
always
been
a
sucker
for
a
good
conspiracy
theory
i
can
see
how
that
could
present
a
whole
world
of
convenience
speaking
of
plans
doing
anything
later
im
working
on
some
stuff
right
now
but
later
maybe
once
youre
finished
escorting
your
guest
around
would
you
like
to
do
something
not
really
just
to
hang
out
if
youre
up
for
it
hello
i
dont
think
weve
met
you
seem
confused
are
you
lost
maybe
you
shouldnt
be
wandering
around
here
aw
you
seem
so
sweet
please
feel
free
to
stay
as
long
as
you
like
