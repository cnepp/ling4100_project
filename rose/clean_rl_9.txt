it
seems
expanding
the
dimensions
of
your
room
cost
us
some
build
grist
but
deploying
the
lathe
did
not
appear
to
incur
any
expense
it
looks
like
certain
objects
are
freebies
probably
to
help
you
set
up
the
game
i
think
its
up
to
you
to
find
out
all
i
can
do
is
drop
stuff
in
your
house
and
move
it
around
apparently
i
dont
think
you
can
as
the
client
you
will
need
to
install
the
server
application
you
should
have
received
both
in
separate
envelopes
i
am
running
both
on
my
computer
right
now
did
you
get
another
envelope
in
the
mail
once
you
install
the
server
and
establish
a
connection
im
sure
you
will
be
able
to
manipulate
my
environment
in
the
same
manner
are
you
sure
you
didnt
get
it
