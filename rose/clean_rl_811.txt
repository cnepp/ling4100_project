its
very
simply
a
session
in
which
nothing
is
prototyped
before
entry
at
all
hence
by
skaias
preemptive
allknowing
and
its
influence
on
the
rest
of
the
incipisphere
there
are
not
even
any
towers
on
prospit
or
derse
built
to
receive
the
split
kernels
see
i
dont
know
what
specifically
led
to
the
failure
to
prototype
anything
but
it
doesnt
really
matter
as
i
said
the
session
was
designed
this
way
before
they
began
playing
any
efforts
to
prototype
may
have
been
in
vain
regardless
possibly
subject
to
sabotage
yes
its
just
another
way
to
create
an
infertile
session
though
by
a
less
catastrophic
and
bloody
route
we
took
to
achieve
the
same
result
by
contrast
it
leads
to
a
rather
harmless
uneventful
session
underlings
remain
unaugmented
and
so
does
the
royalty
and
while
this
may
sound
advantageous
to
the
players
its
a
curse
in
disguise
the
lack
of
prototypings
which
keeps
adversaries
unevolved
has
the
same
influence
on
the
battlefield
without
successive
prototypings
the
battlefield
will
never
reach
its
final
form
which
must
be
fertilized
to
grow
a
new
universe
