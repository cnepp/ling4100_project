to
understand
what
happened
it
really
helps
to
understand
exactly
what
a
scratch
is
when
john
severely
damaged
the
beat
mesa
on
your
planet
and
sent
it
off
to
skaia
to
release
its
temporal
energy
there
you
could
view
it
as
a
kind
of
request
we
were
asking
skaia
to
change
everything
at
a
fundamental
level
and
we
gave
it
the
energy
to
do
so
but
skaia
is
a
very
passive
entity
it
only
knows
and
sees
but
it
never
quite
acts
when
it
is
asked
to
change
everything
there
is
only
so
much
it
has
control
over
in
fact
it
has
control
over
exactly
one
thing
the
defense
portals
it
can
decide
to
send
important
meteors
to
different
points
in
time
than
originally
planned
thus
creating
alternate
realities
offshoots
of
promise
rather
than
futility
and
it
turns
out
the
most
important
meteors
of
all
tend
to
be
the
ones
delivering
the
young
players
to
their
planet
so
all
it
has
to
do
to
change
everything
is
tweak
their
destination
times
a
bit
all
internallyprompted
changes
in
the
postscratch
universe
are
decided
entirely
by
this
modest
adjustment
to
the
parameters
its
a
very
simple
concept
actually
yet
the
consequences
are
dramatic
it
results
in
not
only
a
hard
reset
for
the
session
but
a
partial
reset
for
the
universe
too
due
to
the
many
causal
entanglements
between
a
session
and
its
originating
universe
a
variety
of
different
time
periods
the
simplest
way
to
way
to
look
at
it
is
to
picture
the
original
destinations
of
our
two
groups
of
four
ectobabies
and
switch
them
though
this
is
just
a
slight
oversimplification
while
its
roughly
true
skaia
had
some
peculiar
whims
this
time
