yes
what
else
shes
around
her
name
is
liv
tyler
take
it
up
with
john
what
else
do
you
remember
what
we
decided
not
quite
do
you
remember
anything
else
what
about
why
you
went
to
fight
jack
are
you
sure
so
was
your
decision
a
result
of
desire
or
obligation
i
dont
know
much
about
the
light
shit
to
be
honest
i
may
have
missed
my
chance
to
figure
it
out
mostly
im
doing
what
i
can
to
jog
your
memory
nice
so
what
about
jade
you
didnt
tell
her
your
expedition
with
her
would
result
in
your
death
let
alone
one
shed
inadvertently
cause
or
that
shed
be
stuck
with
the
job
of
resuscitating
you
did
you
not
if
youre
supposed
to
right
i
guess
youre
right
no
reason
to
make
an
effort
to
empathize
if
doing
so
comes
at
the
price
of
oblivion
it
must
be
comforting
to
have
your
aspd
tacitly
supported
by
predestination
antisocial
personality
disorder
it
wasnt
already
awful
believing
you
might
be
dead
so
its
a
disorder
a
complex
and
then
a
disorder
again
for
good
measure
sounds
like
a
positively
delirious
state
of
existence
oh
snap
might
you
loosen
the
purse
strings
on
an
oh
no
he
didnt
i
guess
im
learning
to
be
impressed
by
your
sense
of
obligation
to
inevitable
misfortune
its
a
strange
case
of
inspiration
through
futility
with
what
exactly
hey
these
really
do
not
sound
like
the
words
of
someone
ready
to
face
his
own
death
the
kind
you
dont
wake
up
from
i
mean
the
unseen
bitches
callously
conspiring
to
expect
greatness
from
you
if
thats
how
you
feel
then
why
did
you
insist
on
going
on
the
mission
to
deliver
the
tumor
blackandwhitened
for
giant
yinyang
bomb
