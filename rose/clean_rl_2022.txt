i
dont
mean
to
be
too
analytical
about
getting
to
know
you
really
i
guess
comparisons
are
little
hard
for
me
to
avoid
since
the
adult
version
of
you
played
such
a
significant
role
in
my
life
so
i
cant
help
seeing
the
similarities
when
they
are
there
but
also
you
are
so
clearly
your
own
person
shaped
by
your
own
experiences
and
that
is
the
person
i
would
prefer
to
get
to
know
rather
than
a
young
avatar
for
the
memory
of
a
departed
parent
yet
this
is
the
context
which
somewhat
inescapably
colors
my
perception
of
what
you
reveal
so
while
some
observations
are
in
the
vein
of
predictable
charmingly
so
mind
you
others
i
regard
as
surprising
well
you
arent
you
dont
quite
seem
like
a
person
who
er
i
dont
want
to
ask
anything
that
would
sound
rude
to
you
or
spiteful
to
her
because
i
dont
feel
that
conflicted
about
this
anymore
particularly
since
i
had
my
own
troubles
with
it
so
it
would
be
pretty
hypocritical
let
me
back
up
a
little
it
was
a
long
ride
on
that
meteor
one
experiences
things
over
a
few
years
given
a
lot
of
time
to
think
changes
and
such
about
half
way
through
i
started
thinking
more
about
mom
and
about
you
knowing
that
id
probably
meet
you
and
i
dont
know
live
up
to
the
experience
its
silly
but
im
guessing
you
understand
what
i
mean
basically
i
was
just
nervous
and
it
was
all
mixed
up
with
feelings
of
conflict
and
remorse
over
my
mother
who
to
my
hazy
preteen
recollection
never
wasted
a
day
in
my
life
on
sobriety
she
and
her
habit
put
all
those
days
to
quite
effective
use
actually
and
i
dont
even
quite
remember
the
thought
process
that
led
to
this
but
i
sort
of
ran
with
it
too
the
habit
i
mean
for
a
while
at
least
i
was
still
distraught
about
losing
her
and
wanted
to
understand
her
to
connect
with
her
in
some
way
and
i
guess
that
was
the
only
idea
i
had
and
on
some
level
i
think
connecting
with
her
was
also
a
way
of
preparing
myself
to
meet
you
even
though
that
probably
makes
no
sense
since
you
arent
literally
her
and
dont
share
all
her
i
guess
i
shouldnt
speak
for
you
though
um
so
you
pumpkin
eaters
yeah
i
wait
what
clowns
ok
yes
im
sure
my
mother
knew
the
end
was
coming
too
knowing
that
helped
put
a
lot
of
her
behavior
in
context
for
me
i
was
always
too
young
to
understand
truth
yes
it
sounds
like
your
had
an
incredible
career
but
all
things
considered
i
prefer
being
kid
alive
sexy
lady
me
ultimately
i
concluded
the
same
thing
i
decided
it
wouldnt
be
a
very
dignified
way
to
make
an
entrance
or
for
that
matter
a
very
constructive
way
to
help
out
in
a
struggle
to
preserve
reality
luckily
i
was
able
to
cut
it
out
a
while
ago
i
admit
it
wasnt
easy
but
it
helped
a
lot
to
have
people
around
looking
out
for
me
poke
i
never
had
irl
friends
before
this
trip
its
interesting
to
observe
the
various
ways
they
apply
themselves
to
your
benefit
some
people
are
around
to
make
you
feel
like
youre
worth
sticking
with
even
when
you
fuck
up
and
some
people
are
around
to
kick
your
ass
to
make
sure
you
dont
no
karkat
was
mostly
preoccupied
with
his
own
shenanigans
the
yelling
is
deceptive
hes
a
rather
private
person
vriska
however
she
really
is
quite
an
extravagant
bitch
but
it
turns
out
people
like
that
tend
to
have
some
convenient
assets
such
as
the
sheer
force
of
personality
to
keep
a
bunch
of
idiots
from
falling
apart
dont
get
me
wrong
its
quite
annoying
but
useful
let
it
be
a
lesson
to
us
all
