i
can
see
the
hugs
i
dont
understand
the
pile
thing
ah
yes
vaguely
its
been
a
long
journey
john
i
believe
one
of
the
most
valuable
lessons
that
comes
with
growing
up
is
gaining
the
wisdom
that
gently
informs
you
when
its
time
to
retire
a
meme
surely
you
mean
the
dear
viceroy
bubbles
von
salamancer
right
and
instead
of
you
you
mean
me
thats
when
the
real
tears
will
flow
he
oh
that
sure
is
a
thing
that
would
be
dumb
if
true
