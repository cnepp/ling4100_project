in
some
cultures
the
persistent
refusal
of
a
ladys
invitation
to
play
a
game
with
her
would
be
a
sign
wanton
disrespect
either
that
or
flagrant
homosexuality
i
know
sometimes
i
wonder
how
you
are
ever
allowed
to
pay
for
meals
in
restaurants
it
must
be
hard
to
keep
a
low
profile
when
youre
always
overhearing
awed
voices
whisper
its
that
guy
who
has
a
blog
navigating
the
urban
landscape
im
sure
is
difficult
enough
without
an
obstacle
course
of
deferential
flesh
and
skyward
asses
perhaps
adapting
the
art
of
parkour
to
your
unique
environment
would
help
heavy
is
the
crown
breathtaking
magnanimity
indeed
nary
a
jewel
tumbles
from
your
wishbox
of
daily
exploits
which
i
imagine
does
not
sparkle
baseless
accusation
i
know
this
very
well
i
cannot
hasten
his
mails
delivery
however
more
than
you
know
it
perfectly
mollifies
my
grief
over
the
demise
of
chivalry
