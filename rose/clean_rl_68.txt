have
you
ever
been
in
there
exactly
id
rather
not
get
sidetracked
im
more
interested
in
further
exploring
the
mechanics
of
the
game
than
watching
you
discover
what
sort
outlandish
harlequin
decor
your
father
keeps
in
his
room
will
you
are
you
saying
youve
never
wondered
whats
in
there
or
why
its
been
kept
a
secret
from
you
then
trust
me
you
wont
be
going
right
on
through
i
dont
know
i
cant
see
in
there
but
i
dont
have
a
very
good
feeling
about
it
