are
you
actually
asking
ah
well
yes
i
am
its
a
large
plateau
shaped
like
a
record
its
called
the
beat
mesa
is
the
game
construct
different
in
other
sessions
you
mean
in
sessions
where
victory
is
no
longer
possible
due
to
creating
an
unstoppable
adversary
who
triggers
the
reckoning
prematurely
is
that
sort
of
emergency
common
ok
then
its
like
a
panic
button
for
the
players
to
push
once
they
realize
the
cause
is
lost
who
daves
bro
how
do
i
finish
it
oh
right
the
green
wait
the
green
sun
id
planned
to
take
care
of
that
later
once
john
had
retrieved
the
tumor
whatever
what
will
the
one
who
does
it
have
to
do
i
should
let
them
know
i
see
this
terminology
can
be
very
literal
sometimes
i
have
needles
then
where
do
i
get
ones
that
will
this
really
seems
more
elaborate
than
you
lead
me
to
believe
i
wish
what
id
written
in
my
private
journals
could
be
confined
to
your
dark
spots
youre
being
creepy
again
what
just
please
stop
complimenting
me
