im
working
on
the
bathroom
but
we
are
running
low
on
build
grist
i
see
do
you
suppose
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
game
i
think
its
very
likely
the
walkthroughs
vaguely
suggest
an
impending
threat
before
they
end
the
already
poorly
constructed
sentences
become
even
more
curt
and
ambiguous
as
if
written
hastily
and
with
a
sense
of
alarm
actually
their
dedication
to
updating
the
walkthrough
under
such
circumstances
is
admirable
if
the
meteor
is
a
game
construct
i
think
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
proceed
and
try
to
solve
the
dilemma
on
the
games
terms
try
using
the
lathe
it
says
you
can
use
the
card
on
it
but
isnt
more
specific
than
that
really
it
is
a
labor
to
read
this
drivel
if
i
read
any
more
my
brain
will
need
to
be
spoonfed
from
a
jar
while
it
blows
spit
bubbles
in
a
highchair
i
think
i
will
write
my
own
walkthrough
that
is
after
we
make
sure
you
dont
die
