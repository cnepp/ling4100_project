already
it
just
sounds
like
youre
making
a
rash
decision
based
on
temporary
aggravation
with
a
laughing
puppet
i
thought
we
planned
to
progress
as
far
as
we
could
before
you
went
back
to
gather
information
and
avoid
repeating
mistakes
we
dont
know
jade
is
dead
for
sure
are
you
sure
youre
ready
youll
remember
the
plan
we
discussed
it
still
seems
hasty
to
me
maybe
im
just
not
as
comfortable
with
time
travel
as
you
after
you
go
what
do
you
think
will
happen
to
me
will
i
just
cease
to
exist
maybe
is
there
a
chance
itll
continue
to
exist
and
ill
just
be
here
alone
forever
im
not
sure
which
outcome
is
more
unsettling
what
do
you
think
i
should
do
ok
i
think
the
true
purpose
of
this
game
is
to
see
how
many
qualifiers
we
can
get
to
precede
the
word
self
and
still
understand
what
were
talking
about
if
my
past
self
can
wake
up
sooner
maybe
ill
be
the
one
to
visit
you
first
this
time
ill
fly
by
and
remind
you
youre
already
awake
and
dont
know
it
good
luck
