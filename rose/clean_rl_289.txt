oh
sorry
to
hear
you
were
subjected
to
that
it
was
a
little
melodramatic
in
retrospect
heavyhanded
but
now
its
stuck
on
that
server
forever
broadcasting
the
notes
of
very
confused
girl
sifting
through
the
aftermath
of
just
another
pedestrian
apocalypse
somewhere
in
paradox
space
have
you
ever
written
a
message
you
regretted
instantly
upon
sending
that
line
included
im
sure
you
must
regard
the
walkthrough
as
pretty
quaint
as
a
veteran
of
the
game
at
the
time
when
exactly
did
you
read
it
