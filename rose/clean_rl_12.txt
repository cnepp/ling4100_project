the
one
you
threw
into
the
yard
what
were
you
doing
with
it
in
the
first
place
i
am
not
sensing
a
lot
of
regard
for
the
personal
property
of
others
is
this
how
your
pentup
frustration
with
your
father
manifests
itself
your
bathroom
is
a
mess
did
you
do
that
too
theres
a
cake
in
the
toilet
im
tempted
to
clean
it
up
for
you
my
obsessivecompulsive
disorder
complex
can
a
disorder
also
be
a
complex
sounds
complicated
grab
the
soiled
toilet
