swoon
i
will
do
by
best
to
occupy
myself
as
benignly
and
unmagically
as
possible
until
you
show
up
happy
what
is
this
strange
unsad
emotion
of
which
you
speak
jokes
are
those
the
things
people
say
when
they
want
unusual
noises
to
come
out
of
the
pliable
crescentshaped
holes
sometimes
found
in
peoples
faces
i
need
to
make
a
note
of
this
excuse
me
while
i
open
this
tome
bound
in
the
tanned
writhing
flesh
of
a
tortured
hellscholar
the
screaming
will
subside
shortly
continue
to
not
be
alarmed
as
i
record
your
advice
with
runes
stroked
in
the
black
tears
bled
from
the
corruptionweary
eyes
of
fifty
thousand
imaginary
occultists
and
then
brace
yourself
for
the
fabled
blackdeath
trance
of
the
woegothics
i
will
slip
into
while
quaking
in
the
bloodeldritch
throes
of
the
broodfester
tongues
one
is
not
easily
shaken
from
the
broodfester
tongues
john
they
are
stubborn
throes
besides
you
cant
come
to
my
planet
right
away
you
will
need
to
recover
the
treasure
first
because
it
must
be
delivered
to
me
youd
probably
be
disappointed
if
i
described
it
ok
its
called
the
tumor
