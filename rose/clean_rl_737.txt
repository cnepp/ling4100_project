we
should
be
able
to
get
him
some
help
along
the
way
but
only
if
we
leave
immediately
luckily
for
him
we
have
no
alternative
jack
will
arrive
soon
when
i
said
the
race
would
be
afoot
i
was
being
literal
he
will
follow
our
trail
and
match
our
speed
and
since
this
is
not
the
ideal
scenario
for
a
final
showdown
the
best
we
can
hope
to
do
is
outrun
him
