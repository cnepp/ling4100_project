addressing
me
as
if
im
some
sort
of
spokesperson
for
the
reality
of
magic

cant
needle
me
into
a
defensive
posture
on
the
subject
i
just
dont
care
fine

win
these
are
science
wands
i
am
a
charlatan
thanks
for
the
insinuation
that
im
making
an
effort
to
project
myself
as
a
cartoon
villain
what
a
compliment
nobility
what
are
you
talking
about
no
what
gave
you
that
idea
that
is
exactly
what
happened
you
figured
it
out
youre
a
complete
idiot
what
and
how
was
that
accidentally
or
on
porpoise
oh

alien
romance

really
sweet
of
you
to
offer

to
learn
magic

this
your
first
lesson
in
showmanship
