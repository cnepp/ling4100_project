i
made
a
shortcut
upstairs
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
get
up
there
and
try
the
cards
as
soon
as
possible
also
you
werent
being
terribly
responsive
theyre
perfectly
navigable
im
saving
on
grist
for
now
if
you
keep
slaying
foes
collecting
grist
and
expanding
the
cache
limit
we
may
not
need
to
be
so
economical
with
our
resources
in
the
future
