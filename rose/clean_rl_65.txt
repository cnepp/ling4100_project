what
is
the
specific
problem
you
know
you
like
the
mannequin
dick
accept
it
lets
put
this
into
perspective
you
put
up
with
the
puppet
prostate
because
you
love
it
also
coarse
is
a
good
word
are
you
going
to
start
rapping
about
this
prong
of
flesh
bereft
of
home
found
solace
twixt
a
cleft
of
foam
of
apocalypse
your
thoughts
eclipse
a
painted
pair
of
parted
lips
that
dare
through
kiss
to
stir
the
air
that
teases
tufts
of
orange
hair
and
though
faces
flush
in
lovers
fits
hands
snug
in
plush
as
gloves
befit
then
lets
hope
there
will
be
a
squishy
derriere
somewhere
below
the
handle
to
break
your
fall
