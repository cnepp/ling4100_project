hi
actually
building
up
your
house
has
been
one
of
the
more
trivial
ways
ive
passed
the
time
great
swaths
of
the
structure
may
be
copied
and
pasted
with
little
architectural
consideration
ive
only
bothered
to
do
so
while
in
contemplation
its
relaxing
we
have
a
lot
of
grist
i
dont
recall
any
hard
figures
off
hand
last
i
checked
more
than
a
million
units
of
several
different
types
torrented
between
the
three
of
us
shared
through
an
application
i
unlocked
the
disc
from
your
registry
and
deployed
it
i
convinced
your
nanna
to
install
it
on
your
computer
before
an
imp
threw
it
out
the
window
that
is
my
methods
of
persuasion
have
been
improving
no
upgrades
no
your
consorts
were
utilized
for
that
yes
they
seem
eager
to
receive
simple
instruction
im
guessing
they
find
their
way
back
to
your
house
to
allow
the
client
player
to
remain
productive
while
the
server
player
is
away
no
they
arent
like
i
said
coercion
hasnt
been
much
of
a
problem
why
dont
you
tell
me
what
youve
been
up
to
first
ive
been
curious
but
too
preoccupied
to
inquire
ive
noticed
did
you
yes
i
figured
that
out
anything
else
you
did
are
you
sure
it
was
her
that
was
likely
her
how
was
she
thats
interesting
did
she
seem
happy
fair
enough
investigating
mostly
everything
there
is
to
investigate
information
hidden
in
the
lore
of
our
lands
concealed
in
ruins
and
riddles
im
looking
for
whatever
there
is
to
discover
about
the
game
and
more
importantly
whatever
exceeds
its
boundaries
the
cloaked
traces
of
myth
beyond
its
scope
yes
it
is
in
principle
but
it
wont
happen
its
not
a
matter
of
believing
them
the
writing
is
on
the
wall
literally
this
session
was
never
meant
to
bear
fruit
its
barren
so
to
speak
thats
why
youre
our
leader
john
optimism
through
stalwart
skepticism
is
a
defect
not
everyone
is
lucky
enough
to
be
cursed
with
statements
like
that
are
also
why
youre
our
leader
yes
kind
of
simple
the
objective
is
no
longer
to
win
to
do
as
much
damage
to
the
game
as
possible
to
rip
its
stitches
and
pry
answers
from
the
seams
we
will
snatch
purpose
from
the
jaws
of
futility
are
you
ready
to
wreak
some
havoc
john
