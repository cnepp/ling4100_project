i
dont
think
so
even
if
it
were
it
would
be
a
trivial
obstacle
but
as
it
is
i
think
the
forces
opposing
these
players
are
clandestinely
working
toward
the
same
goal
as
we
are
from
what
i
can
tell
gestures
of
antagonism
while
certainly
posing
legitimate
danger
have
been
factored
in
as
critical
stepping
stones
to
one
destination
shared
by
all
parties
i
dont
know
why
this
is
or
what
the
motives
are
yet
the
appearance
is
one
of
clear
sailing
ahead
but
traces
of
conspiracy
are
everywhere
