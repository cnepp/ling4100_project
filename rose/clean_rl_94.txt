have
we
spoken
before
you
and
your
friends
never
cease
to
invent
ways
to
strengthen
the
credibility
of
your
assertions
i
would
admire
the
sophistication
of
you
and
your
fellow
futuredwellers
a
little
more
if
you
seemed
to
be
aware
the
word
human
only
functions
as
that
sort
of
adjective
in
bad
science
fiction
but
i
wont
be
rude
and
change
the
subject
theres
a
still
a
bit
of
unflagellated
straw
poking
out
of
your
rhetorical
effigy
over
here
i
thought
you
said
we
spoke
in
the
future
i
understand
you
exist
in
some
temporal
stratum
through
which
you
have
communication
access
to
various
points
of
my
timeline
its
not
that
complicated
i
try
to
every
day
with
mixed
results
but
you
see
its
not
that
i
dont
understand
you
its
just
that
i
dont
believe
you
because
its
nonsense
albeit
persistent
and
coordinated
nonsense
why
would
a
bunch
of
temporally
dislocated
trolls
want
to
harass
a
group
of
friends
throughout
completely
random
points
in
time
alright
maybe
you
should
get
some
trolling
tips
from
us
humans
our
sparing
intellects
are
probably
better
suited
to
it
you
want
to
be
my
friend
you
mean
i
did
in
the
future
probably
because
i
remembered
you
mentioning
it
in
the
conversation
were
having
now
hmm
your
commitment
to
this
roleplaying
scenario
is
intriguing
what
choice
do
i
have
but
to
accept
