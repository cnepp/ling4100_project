i
am
piloting
the
moon
through
the
furthest
ring
right
now
at
the
moment
its
passing
through
a
dream
bubble
i
am
visiting
your
dream
in
person
or
you
are
the
one
visiting
me
as
i
travel
in
your
sleep
if
youd
rather
look
at
it
that
way
not
entirely
why
im
already
out
here
might
as
well
go
through
with
it
a
major
league
wind
up
its
always
been
pretty
sad
that
i
seem
to
know
more
about
sports
than
you
which
is
really
saying
something
its
probably
just
ball
hog
oh
lord
the
last
thing
i
want
to
do
is
come
between
a
big
mans
thunder
and
any
particular
hole
he
might
prize
thats
not
even
close
to
being
a
thing
in
football
which
prize
is
that
you
mean
the
most
vaunted
accolade
associated
with
the
gridiron
known
as
stanleys
cup
ill
take
your
word
for
it
how
high
do
they
even
have
to
be
does
the
officiator
have
a
means
of
measurement
on
hand
i
wouldnt
want
to
be
crushed
by
a
nonregulation
sport
pile
poser
so
not
cool
i
forget
what
we
were
doing
exactly
were
we
pursuing
the
hackneyed
debate
over
who
has
the
best
claim
to
self
sacrifice
or
seeing
who
can
outdumbass
the
other
with
obtuse
sports
lingo
im
the
one
stalling
the
moon
is
probably
just
a
speck
in
the
sky
now
due
to
your
strange
beefcake
harangue
i
guess
i
could
wake
back
you
up
if
you
really
want
