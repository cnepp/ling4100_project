you
would
find
it
less
disconcerting
if
the
players
were
alternate
versions
of
us
what
meeting
a
deceased
figure
of
authority
as
a
peer
i
honestly
thought
you
would
find
the
idea
exciting
i
know
im
looking
forward
to
it
not
that
i
recall
but
anecdotes
like
that
just
make
me
more
curious
to
meet
him
personally
shes
your
mom
too
though
you
do
realize
weve
seen
her
already
right
months
ago
in
a
dream
she
was
floating
along
in
derse
pajamas
asleep
yes
youre
wondering
why
i
didnt
tell
you
youre
specifically
wondering
why
i
wasnt
forthcoming
with
an
answer
to
your
question
at
the
time
hey
who
was
that
choice
babe
in
the
pajamas
you
dont
find
it
nostalgic
at
all
retracing
the
steps
of
some
of
our
freudian
semiblunders
in
conversations
past
