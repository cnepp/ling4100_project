why
but
what
if
we
need
your
help
its
hard
to
say
does
the
repopulation
of
your
species
qualify
as
victory
these
things
arent
always
clear
cut
some
outcomes
are
for
your
own
judgment
what
outcome
would
you
like
the
most
ok
if
you
follow
my
advice
i
can
at
least
promise
you
will
find
yourself
in
the
best
position
to
determine
whether
that
may
come
to
pass
can
you
please
come
between
the
two
of
us
you
with
your
inexplicably
heretofore
unmentioned
phosphorescence
and
i
with
my
nighreflective
traffic
cone
orange
sunsari
the
meteor
should
never
be
too
dark
its
soon
or
never
but
not
immediately
even
if
the
route
were
accessible
right
now
it
would
still
behoove
us
to
wait
theres
correspondence
from
john
yet
to
arrive
and
after
that
we
have
to
wait
for
one
final
guest
to
appear
then
we
ride
like
the
solar
wind
the
race
will
be
afoot
oh
lord
now
