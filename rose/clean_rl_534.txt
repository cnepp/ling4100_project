this
doesnt
sound
like
an
especially
admirable
objective
releasing
an
evil
man
who
is
presumably
more
powerful
than
you
an
already
omnipotent
being
am
i
right
but
in
the
process
of
killing
him
and
you
i
release
your
master
who
is
just
as
deadly
then
i
guess
i
dont
have
a
choice
are
you
saying
that
i
will
succeed
in
the
mission
to
destroy
the
sun
im
just
trying
to
ask
as
many
questions
as
i
can
its
the
only
way
to
find
the
dark
spots
in
your
obstinacy
can
you
your
seeds
oh
the
cue
ball
how
did
i
not
notice
this
hmm
is
that
possible
