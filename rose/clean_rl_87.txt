i
dont
like
to
use
the
word
crazy
that
was
a
joke
but
anyway
whether
it
means
you
are
crazy
or
not
consider
this
theory
your
presumably
longstanding
tendency
for
scrawling
this
imagery
is
really
your
subconsious
trying
to
express
something
disturbing
within
you
possibly
something
from
your
past
which
you
have
blocked
out
and
since
you
have
supressed
it
your
conscious
self
cannot
acknowledge
the
drawings
therefore
they
have
been
invisible
until
now
perhaps
because
you
have
seen
evidence
that
conflicts
with
the
worldview
your
subconscious
has
constructed
to
obfuscate
the
truth
that
your
dad
is
not
necessarily
the
clownloving
maniac
you
thought
he
was
all
along
this
negative
attribute
buried
in
your
psyche
may
have
been
projected
on
to
him
and
subsequently
reviled
as
a
sort
of
defense
mechanism
is
it
unthinkable
that
over
the
years
it
was
he
who
believed
you
were
the
one
with
a
passion
for
clowns
because
of
the
all
the
strange
drawings
in
your
room
a
father
then
embraces
a
sons
hobby
to
establish
a
stronger
bond
or
wages
a
campaign
of
passiveaggresive
mockery
of
your
interests
either
is
plausible
i
dont
know
your
dad
that
well
its
awesome
