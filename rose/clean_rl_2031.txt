this
is
the
lightning
round
dave
we
didnt
make
the
rules
anyway
im
ready
to
blow
my
referees
sport
whistle√¢
if
you
dont
answer
before
the
commercially
endorsed
game
clock
expires
dave
even
im
having
less
trouble
referring
to
roxy
by
her
name
consistently
and
i
was
the
one
who
grew
up
knowing
her
as
my
literal
mother
what
is
going
on
with
you
youre
right
how
could
anyone
possibly
read
anything
into
that
sort
of
repeated
slipup
what
if
youre
making
her
uncomfortable
i
hope
it
is
similarly
ok
with
you
if
i
make
the
conscious
decision
to
refrain
from
calling
you
that
ever
unlike
dave
ive
taken
great
pride
in
the
meticulous
maintenance
of
my
internal
filter
i
dont
think
i
have
the
same
luxury
he
does
humiliation
just
makes
my
demons
angrier
to
be
fair
daves
game
is
pretty
flimsy
hes
been
jacking
my
swagger
for
years
he
only
pulls
it
off
because
hes
funny
and
to
be
even
fairer
im
not
actually
much
of
a
psychoanalyst
i
know
just
enough
to
know
that
i
barely
know
anything
and
probably
would
have
benefited
from
i
dont
know
college
or
something
thats
quite
a
scientific
way
of
looking
at
it
maybe
its
even
true
holy
shit
can
someone
come
push
this
nerd
off
the
lilypad
cringeworthy
rap
notwithstanding
i
do
recall
hearing
him
babble
about
wanting
to
be
a
scientist
on
more
than
one
occasion
if
the
world
hadnt
ended
what
was
it
archeology
paleontology
i
dont
recall
my
thoughts
on
higher
education
my
passion
for
the
subject
i
think
was
more
a
contrivance
of
a
very
young
girl
with
misplaced
conviction
in
her
abilities
i
probably
thought
i
could
just
figure
it
all
out
myself
and
skip
the
academic
coronation
i
dont
think
much
about
it
anymore
possibly
because
theres
no
one
left
to
analyze
except
for
the
modest
population
of
this
frog
disc
i
dont
know
what
is
there
even
to
consider
doing
with
godhood
but
concern
oneself
with
evildoers
hm
i
guess
so
im
not
sure
if
i
have
the
inclination
and
realistically
there
isnt
even
much
time
for
that
is
there
were
supposed
to
be
fighting
adversaries
imminently
i
cant
squeeze
it
in
before
the
battle
and
after
well
have
supposedly
won
so
what
would
even
be
the
point
of
doing
it
then
something
always
rubbed
me
the
wrong
way
about
my
quest
i
dont
even
like
the
phrase
its
uncomfortably
formal
and
a
little
foreboding
i
think
the
regimentation
of
it
all
always
struck
me
as
unpalatable
like
consigning
personal
growth
to
the
completion
of
a
glorified
mythheavy
rat
maze
i
probably
wont
