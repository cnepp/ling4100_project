sorry
about
what
i
cant
believe
it
either
i
know
what
you
mean
that
is
more
than
ok
as
long
as
you
are
willing
to
similarly
excuse
the
spectacular
demise
of
my
capacity
for
artful
selfexpression
dirk
he
sounds
like
a
hell
of
a
guy
well
im
told
he
should
be
arriving
here
in
a
little
while
if
hes
anything
like
daves
late
older
brother
and
if
hes
anything
like
me
which
he
apparently
is
then
this
is
when
im
guessing
the
real
party
will
begin
i
want
to
know
things
about
him
such
as
if
he
shares
his
elder
counterparts
avarice
for
soft
puppet
ass
and
if
that
combined
with
his
myriad
vaguely
unsettling
psychological
peculiarities
could
occupy
a
dedicated
team
of
therapists
for
years
hmm
knowing
this
amuses
me
for
some
reason
but
mainly
there
are
things
i
want
to
know
about
you
i
presume
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
later
to
hound
my
biological
father
for
the
dirt
on
his
proclivities
everything
i
think
the
main
difficulty
in
deciding
what
to
ask
is
in
sifting
questions
i
would
have
for
my
mother
that
is
to
say
the
woman
who
raised
me
from
the
questions
i
have
for
you
ok
do
you
really
like
wizards
yes
i
see
as
odd
as
it
sounds
that
actually
does
go
pretty
far
in
letting
me
know
something
about
both
of
you
my
relationship
with
her
was
complicated
but
ive
come
to
see
that
as
mostly
my
fault
i
was
too
young
to
understand
her
ah
right
i
think
im
going
to
have
to
call
the
contest
early
yours
is
the
more
interesting
biography
by
quite
a
lot
she
wrote
hella
books
about
wizards
it
sounds
like
i
fumbled
into
the
wrong
line
of
work
theres
no
money
in
this
sburb
business
well
there
is
it
just
comes
in
incredibly
stupid
denominations
which
are
not
particularly
useful
by
the
way
this
is
kanaya
sorry
for
the
combination
of
bad
manners
and
general
dumbfoundedness
which
precluded
a
more
timely
introduction
welcome
to
maryam
city
population
a
whole
lot
of
great
remarks
like
that
did
you
could
i
read
them
hey
you
got
to
read
mine
did
they
really
oh
i
can
live
with
that
its
always
been
one
of
my
professional
goals
to
write
tales
of
magical
men
so
provocative
they
would
cause
the
permanent
and
unceremonious
dissolution
of
at
least
one
prestigious
award
i
like
weird
but
i
never
even
wrote
the
masterpieces
you
read
i
think
you
may
have
a
view
of
my
abilities
which
i
havent
earned
yet
really
im
not
that
good
i
have
my
own
story
drafts
which
you
can
read
if
you
like
theyre
nothing
special
frankly
