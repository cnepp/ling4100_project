hahahahahahaha
im
sorry
i
cant
sit
here
and
pretend
to
take
this
seriously
i
guess
so
yes
im
fine
this
is
just
so
dumb
my
powers
let
me
see
fortuitous
outcomes
but
i
didnt
see
this
coming
at
all
it
doesnt
register
as
fortuitous
or
otherwise
you
know
why
because
its
completely
meaningless
hahahahaha
no
this
isnt
like
that
trust
me
dave
im
not
grasping
at
straws
here
my
abilities
tend
not
to
leave
such
things
to
speculation
this
development
makes
absolutely
no
sense
not
for
us
as
a
group
and
definitely
not
for
me
personally
or
her
for
that
matter
how
could
this
possibly
mean
anything
for
my
growth
or
personal
development
in
any
way
this
almost
makes
it
official
i
have
no
comprehensible
path
theres
nothing
to
overcome
no
lesson
to
learn
no
cathartic
light
at
the
end
of
this
preposterous
tunnel
not
for
me
at
least
i
seriously
have
the
dumbest
arc
anyone
could
conceivably
imagine
