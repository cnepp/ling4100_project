yes
its
faster
this
way
if
theres
one
thing
you
and
your
friends
regularly
remind
us
its
that
time
is
not
on
our
side
yes
that
has
been
effective
but
you
dont
know
everything
do
you
my
current
strategy
is
comprehensive
your
notes
have
been
helpful
but
the
facts
youve
supplied
are
being
crossreferenced
with
understandings
i
already
have
and
data
gathered
by
the
sort
of
means
presently
on
display
i
still
have
more
questions
for
you
which
i
will
ask
in
time
of
what
dark
magic
you
mean
i
dont
think
they
are
as
nefarious
as
you
might
imagine
many
of
them
seem
to
be
intent
on
helping
us
from
their
whispers
in
my
dreams
not
much
but
quite
a
lot
in
a
failed
timeline
and
now
and
then
memories
surface
from
that
alternate
reality
vague
memories
but
unmistakable
in
familiarity
like
spontaneously
remembering
a
dream
from
years
ago
by
some
inexplicable
catalyst
in
that
reality
they
spoke
to
me
in
my
sleep
and
told
me
much
of
what
i
needed
to
know
including
what
to
do
to
reset
our
timeline
and
create
the
present
reality
i
have
assurances
im
on
the
right
track
surely
you
must
have
spoken
to
the
gods
by
now
what
did
they
tell
you
to
make
you
so
suspicious
it
was
this
surprises
me
good
question
you
didnt
actually
answer
my
question
when
was
it
exactly
that
you
read
my
walkthrough
