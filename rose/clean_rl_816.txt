while
most
landed
in
time
periods
corresponding
with
the
original
group
it
seems
that
two
of
the
new
players
arrived
four
centuries
ahead
of
everyone
else
for
some
bizarre
reason
but
theyre
still
apparently
able
to
communicate
with
their
coplayers
through
i
guess
some
trollianlike
technology
and
theyre
still
able
to
establish
game
connections
with
the
others
so
this
stands
as
an
odd
but
not
otherwise
terribly
significant
detail
ill
give
you
a
hint
it
isnt
us
and
to
think
that
usually
im
the
one
accused
of
knowing
the
future
