go
on
its
ok
they
wouldnt
be
cliches
if
they
didnt
comprise
the
unanimously
understood
bedrock
of
phallic
symbolism
with
no
other
viable
interpretation
hm
well
if
ive
learned
anything
from
my
extensive
skimming
over
the
wikipedia
articles
on
dream
analysis
its
that
this
dream
is
very
unlikely
to
have
any
literal
significance
whatsoever
its
probably
not
about
dying
at
all
yes
in
fact
if
you
were
on
my
couch
that
would
have
been
my
next
question
as
a
licensed
professional
mr
strider
have
you
considered
that
what
you
actually
dread
is
to
have
your
urban
rhythms
exposed
for
what
they
truly
are
which
is
clinically
speaking
just
shy
of
da
bomb
listening
to
you
conjure
imagery
of
my
mother
in
her
underpants
is
definitely
keeping
us
buoyed
high
above
this
swirling
freudian
hellhole
well
done
what
if
youre
wrong
her
not
being
your
mother
dont
worry
youre
probably
safe
luckily
i
can
think
of
no
literary
or
historical
precedent
for
that
sort
of
folly
whatsoever
isnt
it
why
dont
you
tell
me
more
about
your
dream
thats
interesting
ive
read
about
this
certain
texts
say
singing
from
the
unknowable
void
carries
a
message
that
its
recipient
has
been
selected
for
a
mission
of
supreme
cosmic
importance
that
will
result
in
your
death
and
that
of
billions
more
but
one
that
is
essential
to
the
perpetuation
of
existence
itself
its
not
from
a
psychology
text
not
astrology
more
like
zoology
ok
keep
describing
the
dream
though
if
the
rest
of
it
is
incompatible
with
prognoses
of
the
zoologically
dubious
i
will
withdraw
my
insinuation
this
doesnt
strike
you
as
an
impulse
of
self
destruction
so
if
hypothetically
you
were
to
accept
such
a
mission
or
even
insist
upon
one
it
wouldnt
be
in
the
spirit
of
genuine
sacrifice
but
of
escape
aw
we
were
making
good
progress
too
why
did
you
have
to
go
and
remember
