no
for
now
i
have
retired
to
the
safety
of
a
smaller
building
which
is
much
closer
to
the
forest
fire
threatening
my
residence
working
on
it
youre
referring
to
your
brothers
collection
ive
seen
his
websites
i
like
them
interesting
i
am
currently
scrawling
notes
furiously
into
one
of
the
many
psychoanalysis
journals
i
maintain
for
you
published
papers
forthcoming
because
you
know
its
not
like
either
of
us
have
anything
better
to
do
at
the
moment
than
to
evaluate
each
others
radically
debilitating
pathologies
he
wont
answer
me
either
but
i
am
watching
him
i
suspect
he
is
preoccupied
with
the
fact
that
he
just
had
a
bucket
of
water
dumped
on
his
head
by
the
ghost
of
his
dead
grandmother
who
also
happens
to
be
dressed
like
a
clown
