who
why
would
someone
wear
sunglasses
while
using
a
computer
i
know
that
anyone
committed
to
such
an
affectation
could
only
be
striving
to
mask
a
severe
insecurity
complex
and
likely
harbors
a
crisis
of
selfimage
ive
been
known
to
lend
my
charitable
attention
to
such
people
but
only
bossed
around
by
them
insofar
as
the
psychiatric
professional
has
cause
to
humor
the
demented
for
analytical
purposes
or
maybe
as
a
lab
chimp
commands
the
zookeepers
interest
in
its
shit
by
forcing
him
to
duck
under
its
trajectory
now
and
then
oh
that
guy
tender
spots
your
word
choices
are
evocative
is
your
design
to
couple
with
this
gentleman
if
youre
trying
to
get
his
goat
you
should
know
he
only
stocks
the
animal
in
the
first
place
for
ironic
purposes
then
were
agreed
you
are
hellbent
upon
literally
seizing
his
shrill
bearded
livestock
ill
assist
you
if
you
really
want
to
burn
him
i
recommend
poetry
yes
they
are
the
most
delicious
bunches
we
have
i
suggest
you
serve
these
crisp
bunches
of
honey
and
verbal
annihilation
to
him
as
part
of
a
complete
breakfast
a
deft
clusterbombing
of
this
sort
will
leave
nothing
wriggling
from
the
razed
earth
except
sulfurous
tresses
while
it
cracks
and
turns
black
yeah
i
suppose
what
im
saying
is
this
drop
some
hard
peerreviewed
motherfuckin
science
on
his
ass
some
seriously
government
funded
shit
it
will
destroy
him
your
obvious
cunning
with
words
should
depants
strider
with
such
vivid
empyrean
tempest
a
netherregional
sonic
boom
is
certain
inevitability
but
even
so
consider
me
at
your
disposal
to
help
craft
a
comeuppance
of
such
unqualified
devastation
the
angels
will
weep
pearlstrings
of
little
urban
fellows
cantillating
an
unbroken
chorus
of
oh
snaps
ummmm
