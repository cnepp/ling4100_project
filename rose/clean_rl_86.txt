it
looks
like
you
were
in
your
fathers
room
recently
and
how
did
it
make
you
feel
to
discover
what
was
in
there
maybe
i
am
just
being
a
friend
that
doesnt
matter
what
matters
is
how
seeing
it
affected
you
i
think
it
clearly
has
in
some
way
is
it
fair
to
say
this
changed
your
perception
of
your
father
is
it
such
a
stretch
to
conclude
it
changed
your
perception
of
other
things
as
well
