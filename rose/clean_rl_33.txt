i
cant
find
it
anywhere
in
the
house
no
time
to
worry
about
it
the
next
thing
we
should
do
is
get
your
server
copy
of
the
game
from
the
car
you
need
to
connect
to
my
client
so
i
can
repeat
your
steps
and
presumably
join
you
wherever
you
are
we
should
do
this
quickly
before
my
house
burns
down
there
will
be
soon
it
looks
like
it
requires
a
lot
of
grist
to
move
i
dont
have
enough
to
relocate
the
door
either
zero
i
have
a
better
idea
meet
me
upstairs
