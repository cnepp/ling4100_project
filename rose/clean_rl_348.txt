did
you
know
your
planet
was
on
fire
yes
it
makes
a
good
light
for
reading
actually
yes
i
do
seem
to
be
shadowed
by
each
mystery
and
its
somber
cortege
of
riddles
dont
i
first
of
all
i
should
preface
this
conversation
by
saying
i
know
exactly
what
you
and
jade
are
going
to
do
the
more
of
our
future
ive
been
allowed
to
see
the
more
im
presented
with
a
challenge
im
not
very
comfortable
with
the
trolls
have
tipped
us
off
about
whats
to
come
without
any
regard
for
the
consequences
as
appears
to
be
their
nature
but
maybe
thats
why
its
worked
for
them
maybe
their
indiscretion
mingles
with
the
cosmic
noise
that
is
the
fabric
of
temporal
uncertainty
sorry
john
im
just
nervous
about
it
about
whether
telling
you
what
you
definitely
will
or
wont
do
will
alter
a
predetermined
outcome
the
result
would
be
a
splintered
timeline
and
we
would
all
be
sentenced
to
eventual
oblivion
im
presently
optimistic
this
has
not
happened
yet
and
this
is
still
the
alpha
timeline
id
like
to
keep
it
that
way
yes
sort
of
it
isnt
much
fun
john
living
for
months
in
an
offshoot
reality
waiting
for
the
curtain
to
drop
hmm
i
guess
i
can
permit
myself
to
tell
you
this
somewhat
definitively
failing
to
prototype
the
kernel
is
the
absolute
worst
thing
that
you
could
possibly
do
like
ever
we
would
come
into
possession
of
all
the
disasters
exhaustive
possession
monopolization
in
fact
because
the
battlefield
will
not
be
able
to
heal
and
then
transform
it
will
not
reach
the
stage
which
allows
it
to
become
ready
to
receive
our
universe
yes
because
if
it
does
not
reach
this
stage
we
will
not
be
able
to
recover
the
treasure
hidden
in
its
core
which
is
to
say
you
will
not
be
able
to
recover
it
when
you
go
to
sleep
again
yes
this
is
the
treasure
that
will
give
us
hope
but
only
if
it
comes
into
being
in
the
first
place
john
what
is
that
sound
it
seems
to
be
a
ticking
noise
