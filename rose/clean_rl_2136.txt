so
what
happened
so
you
were
only
there
to
release
her
are
you
sure
there
isnt
something
important
for
you
to
do
now
that
youre
alive
and
with
us
i
dont
mean
to
badger
you
im
just
wondering
how
you
fit
into
all
this
getting
to
wear
a
oneofakind
ring
and
returning
to
join
a
group
about
to
wage
a
pivotal
battle
that
strikes
me
as
the
profile
of
someone
meant
to
do
something
important
what
do
you
think
youll
do
i
guess
so
first
dave
tells
me
human
beings
dont
have
arcs
and
now
youre
telling
me
the
culmination
of
an
epic
doesnt
require
a
messianic
archetype
to
return
from
the
dead
thereby
providing
the
key
to
everyones
salvation
i
wonder
what
sturdy
and
timetested
narrative
construct
jade
is
going
to
debunk
whenever
she
wakes
up
maybe
she
will
lay
waste
to
the
notion
of
endgame
ships
karkat
wont
be
happy
about
that
how
so
isnt
that
just
how
it
always
is
with
altselves
so
cryptic
