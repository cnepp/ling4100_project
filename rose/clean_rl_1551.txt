why
am
i
talking
to
myself
i
think
ive
spent
too
much
time
around
dave
ive
also
probably
spent
too
much
time
sharing
his
genes
why
must
our
family
tree
be
plagued
by
so
many
shameless
soliloquists
i
wonder
if
our
young
parents
are
like
this
i
wonder
if
i
will
ever
find
out
and
what
should
i
do
in
the
meantime
should
i
should
i
really
work
on
completing
my
personal
planetary
quest
that
whole
thing
where
i
learn
to
play
the
rain
i
guess
i
should
feel
exhilarated
to
have
the
chance
again
after
all
these
years
of
course
i
should
but
then
why
does
it
sound
like
such
a
drag
i
havent
played
the
violin
in
a
long
time
i
wonder
if
i
even
remember
how
honestly
i
cant
recall
ever
feeling
less
motivated
to
satisfy
a
looming
obligation
i
think
my
quest
was
fundamentally
bound
to
the
nature
of
this
land
which
was
customized
to
the
profile
needs
and
potential
for
growth
of
a
thirteen
yearold
girl
but
im
not
that
person
anymore
what
if
i
what
if
i
just
didnt
bother
doing
it
like
ever
would
anyone
notice
my
dereliction
would
the
powers
that
be
strike
me
down
where
i
loaf
what
if
i
just
said
fuck
it
what
then
silly
pink
tortoise
shells
hmmmm
i
guess
i
should
stop
procrastinating
and
have
this
conversation
with
kanaya
