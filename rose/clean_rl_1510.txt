i
take
it
you
are
still
detoxing
from
your
overdose
of
appalling
harlequin
nectar
do
you
need
a
turn
with
the
pillow
you
should
try
not
to
consume
so
much
sugar
its
really
bad
for
you
good
point
we
seriously
have
to
curtail
our
dependence
on
these
respective
liquids
the
situation
has
become
embarrassing
for
everyone
maybe
you
and
i
should
form
some
sort
of
support
group
isnt
that
what
people
do
im
doing
my
best
to
dredge
the
memory
of
my
dead
civilization
for
salient
protocol
i
think
thats
what
were
supposed
to
do
once
when
humanity
was
still
a
thing
those
like
us
with
similar
problems
would
band
together
smoke
cigarettes
and
psychologically
dismantle
each
other
but
like
in
a
positive
way
it
surely
will
be
do
you
have
any
cigarettes
i
suppose
we
could
use
some
sticks
of
your
chalk
in
a
pinch
these
turtles
probably
wont
know
the
difference
well
we
have
to
do
something
im
supposed
to
be
guiding
our
team
to
a
fortuitous
outcome
with
my
fancy
light
powers
how
am
i
supposed
to
lead
and
inspire
from
under
a
velvet
pillow
also
my
girlfriend
thinks
im
an
idiot
so
theres
that
sure
they
do
i
foresaw
that
they
would
magically
not
unlike
a
majestic
wizardress
i
think
at
least
im
pretty
sure
i
did
at
one
point
before
getting
repeatedly
plastered
dont
you
remember
what
i
said
when
we
first
met
i
said
your
abilities
would
probably
come
in
handy
didnt
i
yeah
maybe
you
just
need
to
dig
deep
down
and
believe
in
yourself
why
dont
you
give
that
a
shot
im
sure
when
the
time
comes
accessing
your
full
potential
will
involve
tapping
into
just
the
right
platitude
i
dont
know
im
too
hung
over
to
give
good
seering
advice
you
see
this
is
the
problem
hence
the
need
for
a
notentirelyironic
support
group
lets
do
it
i
declare
rainbow
rumpus
rehab
town
is
now
in
session
where
the
fuck
is
a
gavel
when
you
need
one
