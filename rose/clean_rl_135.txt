i
spoke
with
jaspers
i
didnt
understand
what
he
told
me
he
said
ill
understand
once
i
wake
up
for
some
reason
this
made
me
think
of
you
we
wouldnt
happen
to
be
talking
about
awakening
in
a
sort
of
breezy
philosophical
sense
would
we
is
my
dead
cat
concerned
with
my
enlightenment
should
i
prepare
to
shed
this
coil
of
ignorance
and
suffering
i
doubt
i
could
reproduce
the
statements
with
fidelity
it
was
like
listening
to
a
five
yearold
describe
a
dream
the
content
manages
to
take
a
back
seat
to
the
simple
heartwarming
spectacle
of
the
moment
i
think
i
get
it
i
take
it
your
dream
self
is
wide
awake
when
you
sleep
and
would
i
be
out
of
line
in
additionally
presuming
this
has
been
the
case
for
many
years
at
least
as
long
as
ive
known
you
that
was
to
be
my
next
wild
presumption
so
when
i
wake
up
can
i
look
forward
to
being
able
to
message
people
in
my
sleep
too
oh
right
i
forgot
about
your
robot
my
short
term
recall
seems
to
eschew
the
profoundly
ridiculous
im
not
sure
if
necessity
is
a
concept
id
associate
with
such
a
contraption
even
under
some
of
the
more
obscure
scenarios
imaginable
but
good
to
know
i
guess
heres
another
question
which
im
sure
will
look
stupid
once
ive
finished
typing
it
if
my
dream
self
is
asleep
does
that
mean
shes
dreaming
and
if
she
is
whos
dreaming
the
dream
her
or
me
ok
how
do
i
wake
up
what
stuff
tell
me
what
are
you
saying
he
said
i
defaced
the
walls
of
my
room
while
not
appearing
to
be
cognizant
of
the
scrawlings
like
john
i
really
hope
thats
not
what
youre
saying
it
might
freak
me
out
hold
on
