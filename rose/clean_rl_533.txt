then
can
you
at
least
tell
me
if
we
will
be
successful
in
preserving
ourselves
after
the
reset
so
if
the
scratch
isnt
specifically
meant
to
banish
jack
from
the
session
and
our
quest
to
destroy
the
sun
is
meant
to
kill
him
why
is
the
reset
necessary
at
all
especially
if
it
means
oblivion
for
us
i
guess
but
its
a
little
disheartening
to
learn
im
now
faced
with
not
one
but
two
suicide
missions
at
once
one
to
destroy
jacks
power
source
and
defend
all
of
existence
and
another
to
ensure
our
cosmic
progeny
at
the
price
of
oblivion
immortality
do
you
mean
ascending
to
the
god
tier
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
i
wont
the
trolls
have
not
indicated
i
will
die
on
my
quest
bed
or
that
any
of
us
will
aside
from
john
instead
ive
been
given
a
more
troubling
and
ambiguous
forecast
are
you
saying
i
will
oh
well
will
i
fine
maybe
this
question
will
suit
you
better
is
it
probable
then
whats
your
answer
thats
a
strange
answer
why
such
a
precise
probability
two
ways
by
dying
on
the
quest
bed
on
my
planet
and
some
other
way
is
there
another
quest
bed
somewhere
where
thats
true
you
mentioned
immortality
godhood
makes
one
immortal
a
god
tier
will
live
forever
with
no
caveats
how
are
those
terms
defined
which
sort
of
death
will
you
have
when
i
destroy
the
sun
is
this
when
you
are
going
to
tell
me
why
you
want
to
die
i
sense
its
not
just
because
youre
getting
bored
with
immortality
then
why
that
almost
sounds
like
martyrdom
are
you
sure
it
wont
be
a
heros
death
who
is
he
