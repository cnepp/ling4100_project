i
know
right
rolls
eyes
he
is
just
this
silly
guy
i
met
when
i
woke
up
here
he
seemed
to
be
curious
about
me
and
followed
me
around
for
a
while
also
i
noticed
he
was
wearing
my
bedsheet
i
dont
know
there
seems
to
be
this
whole
cult
full
of
people
who
worship
my
ghost
sheets
i
ran
into
a
bunch
of
them
in
a
salamander
village
they
are
all
completely
ridiculous
so
i
guess
he
is
a
member
of
the
cult
derp
they
arent
idolizing
me
its
my
dumb
bedsheets
they
love
its
so
stupid
oh
also
another
thing
about
him
he
has
the
queens
ring
ive
tried
i
asked
him
politely
for
it
and
everything
but
he
is
very
protective
of
it
actually
i
think
its
ok
i
think
he
is
supposed
to
keep
it
yes
once
i
saw
something
in
the
clouds
it
was
hard
to
tell
what
was
going
on
but
i
saw
him
im
pretty
sure
it
was
the
future
and
he
had
the
ring
and
and
then
the
cloud
stopped
showing
me
but
i
am
pretty
sure
that
some
day
he
will
have
to
wear
it
so
i
think
i
will
just
let
him
keep
it
for
some
reason
i
trust
him
yeah
trust
all
around
how
trustworthy
do
you
even
have
to
be
to
confide
in
someone
like
that
anyway
i
guess
thats
enough
of
that
nonsense
i
should
keep
looking
for
my
dad
maybe
if
i
fly
around
in
this
car
with
this
guy
beeping
here
the
noise
will
get
his
attention
and
he
will
find
me
