maybe
thats
why
you
felt
weird
seeing
a
version
of
you
that
wasnt
like
you
at
all
maybe
it
doesnt
have
to
work
that
way
though
what
if
those
are
just
some
facts
about
her
which
let
her
come
back
to
life
but
they
dont
have
to
mean
anything
other
than
that
like
anything
about
having
to
do
some
huge
fancy
thing
huh
ok
i
dont
know
what
stuff
youre
going
on
about
there
but
i
just
dont
think
she
should
feel
like
she
has
to
do
anything
she
doesnt
want
to
