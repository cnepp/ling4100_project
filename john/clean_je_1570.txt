huh
tricks
i
guess
i
dont
know
any
actual
tricks
per
se
aside
from
how
to
use
some
of
my
powers
but
i
dont
know
if
the
same
tricks
apply
to
using
your
powers
i
said
maybe
i
could
i
dunno
i
was
just
throwing
it
out
there
like
maybe
if
i
told
you
about
some
of
the
experiences
i
had
when
i
was
learning
to
do
my
windy
stuff
you
might
have
some
kind
of
voidey
epiphany
yes
ok
um
ive
noticed
whenever
i
learn
to
do
new
things
with
my
powers
its
usually
in
response
to
something
like
something
important
that
has
to
be
done
so
why
are
you
trying
to
make
this
spike
ball
and
how
important
does
it
feel
to
you
i
see
what
actually
is
this
spike
ball
if
you
dont
mind
my
asking
then
maybe
the
fact
that
youre
conflicted
about
it
is
why
youre
having
trouble
if
you
think
its
important
to
make
but
dont
want
to
give
it
to
the
bad
guys
why
dont
you
just
break
out
of
jail
then
you
could
try
to
make
the
egg
at
your
own
discretion
and
use
it
however
you
think
is
best
yeah
it
is
a
tricky
situation
with
grimbark
jade
on
the
loose
thats
for
sure
but
ive
been
managing
to
evade
her
i
just
swoosh
the
breeze
around
to
hide
my
scent
and
dissolve
into
wind
and
fly
away
if
she
finds
me
maybe
you
could
do
something
like
that
too
it
seems
to
me
if
anyone
should
be
able
to
avoid
detection
using
their
powers
it
would
be
a
void
player
get
it
a
void
as
in
avoid
heh
oh
right
