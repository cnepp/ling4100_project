ok
fine
nothing
no
well
maybe
im
just
getting
a
little
tired
of
being
stuck
on
this
lame
boat
dont
you
think
its
gotten
kind
of
old
oh
sure
im
sure
its
great
for
you
you
get
to
spend
your
days
smooching
and
breaking
up
with
dave
sprite
and
what
not
and
you
can
shrink
down
to
any
old
planet
you
feel
like
any
time
whereas
i
have
to
make
this
whole
big
deal
of
asking
you
to
shrink
or
unshrink
me
and
i
know
but
you
think
i
want
to
bug
you
about
that
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
when
youre
busy
and
on
dates
and
stuff
i
just
happen
to
have
respect
for
something
called
personal
boundaries
jade
and
its
not
like
theres
really
anyone
else
to
talk
to
except
the
inscrutable
chess
people
and
a
bunch
of
brainless
consorts
and
an
idiot
cat
princess
oh
and
also
nanna
but
i
mean
shes
my
grandmother
and
shes
great
but
a
guy
can
only
spend
so
much
quality
time
with
his
grandmother
before
he
starts
to
feel
like
kind
of
a
loser
whose
friends
are
too
busy
to
spend
time
with
him
and
i
still
never
visit
any
interesting
dream
bubbles
and
we
cant
even
finish
our
cool
planet
quests
because
the
moment
we
broke
through
the
window
all
our
denizens
decided
to
go
back
to
sleep
and
i
guess
what
im
saying
is
im
more
than
ready
to
get
to
the
other
window
and
meet
our
friends
and
other
new
people
and
stuff
are
you
sure
you
cant
make
the
ship
go
faster
and
how
fast
is
that
again
well
cant
you
use
your
space
powers
and
bump
it
up
a
notch
and
why
cant
you
teleport
us
again
is
that
why
we
cant
go
faster
than
light
either
ok
i
mean
i
know
that
but
this
isnt
really
a
regular
place
right
isnt
the
speed
of
light
like
a
thousand
miles
a
second
so
what
does
that
really
mean
here
are
miles
and
seconds
the
same
here
as
on
earth
how
does
this
nonsense
dimension
were
racing
through
jive
with
all
the
relativity
mumbo
jumbo
no
i
dont
want
to
talk
about
physics
i
dont
know
anything
about
the
laws
of
physics
because
they
are
hard
and
boring
i
simply
would
like
them
to
behave
in
a
way
that
is
most
convenient
to
me
and
my
life
is
that
really
asking
too
much
well
guess
what
science
is
stupid
bullshit
no
magic
is
awesome
science
blows
the
end
