ha
ha
i
can
imagine
i
think
life
was
a
lot
more
boring
on
the
ship
but
we
talked
about
you
all
a
lot
we
would
always
wonder
how
you
and
rose
were
managing
to
get
along
with
all
those
crazy
trolls
i
think
mostly
we
pictured
a
lot
of
arguments
im
still
getting
used
to
having
such
insane
limitless
powers
that
let
me
go
anywhere
i
want
its
tempting
to
go
to
time
periods
like
yours
and
find
out
what
i
missed
but
i
dont
want
to
mess
with
too
much
anymore
since
it
seems
like
i
got
the
time
line
to
a
nice
stable
place
as
it
is
so
i
guess
i
just
have
to
do
what
any
regular
guy
does
and
imagine
fondly
what
it
would
be
like
if
i
got
to
travel
with
you
guys
i
wonder
if
i
would
have
gotten
like
absorbed
in
troll
culture
too
or
troll
ways
of
thinking
i
wonder
if
i
would
have
learned
to
understand
black
romance
its
such
a
goofy
idea
but
it
seems
pretty
important
to
trolls
yeah
years
ago
when
we
first
met
the
trolls
i
remember
being
pretty
fascinated
by
all
our
cultural
differences
when
karkat
and
vriska
were
telling
me
about
them
i
remember
really
sincerely
trying
to
understand
it
all
from
their
point
of
view
its
hard
though
i
still
think
about
the
idea
of
black
romance
sometimes
and
try
to
imagine
how
that
really
works
or
feels
i
dont
know
do
you
understand
it
mainly
the
idea
of
hating
somebody
and
translating
that
into
attraction
or
some
kind
of
romancey
feeling
it
feels
so
alien
to
me
and
youre
right
i
have
a
really
hard
time
even
hating
anyone
in
the
first
place
i
mean
i
get
annoyed
by
people
sure
no
not
really
well
sometimes
but
not
much
i
always
tended
to
exaggerate
my
grievances
with
you
for
the
sake
of
laughs
a
better
example
is
more
recently
when
i
was
doing
my
retcon
mission
i
was
getting
really
annoyed
with
terezi
and
her
mind
games
it
definitely
never
crossed
the
line
to
hate
though
because
we
were
working
together
to
try
and
fix
a
dire
situation
and
even
though
shes
weird
and
insane
shes
otherwise
a
pretty
good
friend
but
all
her
needling
and
japes
at
totally
inappropriate
times
when
there
was
so
much
on
the
line
argh
it
was
so
frustrating
what
n
no
but
i
dont
hate
her
and
im
sure
i
never
will
im
just
saying
i
find
her
like
somewhat
annoying
and
really
aggravating
a
lot
of
the
time
but
thats
it
ok
but
i
dont
know
if
im
expressing
myself
clearly
i
felt
aggravated
by
her
a
lot
but
that
doesnt
fully
describe
like
there
were
those
negative
feelings
but
also
but
no
this
is
messed
up
argh
it
cant
be
true
though
it
feels
so
fucked
up
what
if
youre
right
though
erg
no
no
no
no
no
its
fucked
up
though
aw
man
i
just
wanted
to
have
a
nice
catchup
chat
not
get
so
transparently
owned
at
the
trollmances
i
dont
think
i
want
it
to
feel
normalized
though
im
not
ready
to
like
admit
that
i
have
some
warped
spade
crush
on
her
based
on
some
feeling
i
dont
understand
and
makes
no
sense
to
me
oh
god
what
if
its
true
i
have
to
try
as
hard
as
i
can
to
suppress
this
feeling
and
make
sure
i
never
think
about
it
again
fuck
yeah
probably
just
please
dont
tell
her
about
any
of
this
ok
guys
