hey
aradia
was
it
can
i
ask
you
something
you
seem
reasonable
and
pretty
nice
so
im
wondering
how
do
you
feel
about
all
this
about
what
vriska
and
her
pirate
buddies
are
doing
no
i
know
of
course
it
would
be
great
to
have
an
awesome
secret
weapon
whatever
it
is
i
mean
how
do
you
feel
about
the
way
theyve
been
searching
for
it
by
using
all
your
ghost
clone
friends
as
bait
and
getting
the
bad
guy
to
blow
them
all
up
to
reveal
the
way
to
the
treasure
ok
yes
lets
assume
it
was
the
only
way
to
find
it
granted
but
i
mean
does
that
really
make
it
the
right
way
to
beat
him
well
how
do
you
feel
about
it
most
of
the
other
pirates
seem
cool
with
it
so
im
wondering
if
you
feel
differently
um
sort
of
but
i
didnt
know
what
you
were
all
doing
yet
yeah
but
im
just
hanging
out
here
cause
im
asleep
what
else
was
i
going
to
do
