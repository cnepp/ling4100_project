i
was
so
confused
when
that
happened
i
was
sure
the
other
me
knew
so
much
more
than
i
did
at
the
time
which
is
kind
of
true
but
also
kind
of
not
like
if
i
traveled
back
here
and
altered
reality
in
a
non
time
travely
way
then
why
do
i
remember
doing
it
did
i
just
make
some
sort
of
stable
retcon
loop
does
that
even
make
sense
i
think
i
did
the
right
thing
though
zapping
my
other
self
out
of
there
it
was
like
a
retroactively
preemptive
continuity
adjustment
retroactively
preemptive
what
am
i
even
talking
about
this
power
is
kind
of
complicated
i
need
to
be
more
careful
