o
thats
right
that
makes
it
seem
not
so
boring
i
guess
but
still
i
would
feel
really
bad
leaving
you
here
even
if
you
do
have
a
million
salamanders
and
chess
guys
to
keep
you
company
you
are
my
friend
and
also
my
sortasister
and
we
just
met
for
the
first
time
ever
a
few
minutes
ago
im
not
going
to
be
like
welp
see
ya
in
three
years
jade
yeah
now
that
you
mention
it
im
pretty
beat
also
starving
heheh
i
sure
hope
there
are
things
to
eat
on
those
planets
there
were
a
lot
of
weird
glowing
mushrooms
on
lowas
i
dunno
about
those
i
seem
to
remember
a
bunch
of
farms
on
the
battlefield
yeah
probably
pff
hell
we
could
just
raid
all
of
our
fridges
and
alchemize
some
tasty
grub
ok
cool
but
it
would
still
be
nice
to
say
hi
to
everybody
before
they
leave
just
to
let
them
know
how
were
doing
like
one
of
the
last
things
rose
saw
before
she
died
was
me
dying
i
wonder
if
she
knows
im
ok
yeah
probably
then
maybe
ill
just
hop
over
real
fast
and
give
karkat
a
fist
bump
and
give
dave
a
hard
time
about
his
hella
tight
little
hood
and
then
hop
back
aw
man
really
thats
stupid
what
is
with
all
these
rules
isnt
that
a
contradiction
though
if
there
are
limits
to
your
powers
you
cant
exactly
be
omnipotent
can
you
more
like
semipotent
demidogs
heh
can
you
not
control
the
woofs
so
the
dog
ears
is
that
a
permanent
thing
now
or
what
i
like
them
you
are
like
a
furry
now
but
not
really
the
weird
kind
that
people
on
the
internet
like
to
have
sex
with
in
their
imagination
