you
mean
generic
objects
yes
not
really
you
seem
pretty
smart
to
me
yeah
you
have
a
funny
and
snappy
way
of
talking
like
dave
but
unlike
that
knucklehead
i
sense
that
behind
all
your
jokes
you
are
probably
some
kind
of
brainiac
like
rose
dont
get
me
wrong
i
meant
knucklehead
in
a
good
way
dave
is
actually
the
best
dude
you
would
like
him
argh
i
mean
yes
pretty
much
honestly
it
gets
weird
to
think
about
all
our
relations
in
that
way
sometimes
um
i
think
we
should
just
change
the
subject
we
were
talking
about
blank
skies
and
fort
blocks
and
such
and
you
thought
you
should
know
more
about
things
like
that
as
a
void
hero
which
reminds
me
do
you
think
you
are
any
closer
to
making
that
alien
egg
i
mean
after
seeing
nix
did
you
feel
like
a
power
boost
or
anything
no
not
like
mega
man
i
mean
like
well
did
she
oh
well
thats
kind
of
a
bummer
i
hope
you
werent
shortchanged
out
of
an
important
mystical
and
spiritual
process
of
self
discovery
what
yeah
or
wait
what
if
this
was
part
of
it
your
quest
like
to
be
here
and
learn
to
use
your
powers
better
we
are
kind
of
in
a
realm
of
literal
nothingness
right
now
maybe
you
will
be
able
to
draw
energy
or
inspiration
from
the
void
or
whatever
does
that
make
sense
oh
sweet
i
was
just
grasping
at
straws
there
but
now
that
you
agree
im
suddenly
a
lot
more
confident
in
my
theory
so
why
dont
you
try
it
out
again
sure
i
guess
theres
really
no
hurry
not
in
this
place
at
least
i
dont
think
this
place
has
any
bearing
on
other
time
lines
its
almost
like
like
taking
a
time
out
from
our
canonical
lives
so
if
you
wanted
you
could
take
as
much
time
to
practice
here
as
you
need
me
too
even
though
im
not
sure
i
have
one
anymore
