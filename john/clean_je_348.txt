rose
i
have
a
question
and
i
am
in
a
hurry
so
hurry
up
and
answer
oh
it
is
ok
haha
thats
a
confusing
thing
you
said
but
that
topic
will
have
to
wait
jade
is
minutes
away
from
entering
and
i
need
to
decide
what
to
do
with
this
kernel
sprite
i
really
dont
want
to
mess
up
and
do
something
stupid
i
was
thinking
about
not
prototyping
at
all
to
not
give
the
monsters
any
new
powers
what
do
you
think
rose
i
thought
id
ask
since
you
seem
to
know
all
the
mysteries
yes
that
is
exactly
what
i
was
going
to
say
um
ok
bluhhhhhh
rose
tick
tick
tick
oh
wow
you
mean
like
when
i
died
in
another
dimension
because
terezi
hornswoggled
me
whats
not
oh
ok
i
see
well
uh
is
there
anything
you
can
tell
me
what
oh
no
then
i
guess
i
will
not
do
that
why
is
it
so
bad
but
i
thought
you
said
it
wasnt
going
to
be
able
to
make
a
universe
anyway
wasnt
it
barren
or
something
so
why
is
it
important
ohhhhhh
why
didnt
you
say
so
of
course
the
answer
is
treasure
what
is
the
treasure
exactly
what
sound
aaaahh
yeah
ive
got
to
go
we
can
chat
about
treasure
later
anyway
i
will
sort
out
this
prototyping
silliness
myself
thanks
rose
