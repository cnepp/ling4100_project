ok
i
think
im
ready
to
take
this
legendary
nap
and
then
climb
the
god
tiers
i
guess
yeah
maybe
it
is
a
little
too
exciting
i
am
not
sleepy
at
all
also
this
is
not
much
of
a
bed
more
like
a
really
hard
slab
of
rock
i
dont
see
how
i
will
be
able
to
sleep
um
you
mean
youre
asking
me
this
time
instead
of
just
doing
it
what
happened
to
you
wanting
to
be
responsible
for
me
becoming
a
hero
well
im
supposed
to
go
to
sleep
to
realize
my
destiny
and
you
have
the
ability
to
make
me
do
that
so
i
dont
really
see
the
harm
in
that
it
sounds
like
it
is
just
the
practical
thing
to
do
yes
that
is
my
decision
vriska
please
put
me
to
sleep
