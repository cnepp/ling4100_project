your
brand
has
good
taste
in
friends
and
kicks
ass
hey
how
do
you
think
kanaya
and
karkat
are
doing
do
you
think
theyll
be
successful
at
talking
to
a
monster
i
dont
know
so
you
think
theyre
going
to
pull
it
off
then
well
the
idea
was
to
release
the
frog
i
think
thats
what
vriska
said
you
really
trust
kanaya
dont
you
not
to
change
the
subject
too
hard
into
something
maybe
you
dont
want
to
talk
about
because
of
your
brand
but
i
think
you
make
a
nice
couple
yes
i
thought
so
last
time
i
was
hanging
out
with
you
both
in
the
screwed
up
time
line
but
didnt
say
anything
then
i
think
its
still
true
im
glad
it
didnt
change
when
i
retconned
some
things
maybe
that
means
its
a
strong
relationship
if
it
can
survive
god
whatever
the
hell
happened
a
hard
three
year
reboot
and
then
the
sudden
presence
of
vriska
haha
