poor
rose
she
was
always
too
brave
for
her
own
good
this
is
exactly
what
happened
last
time
um
it
was
years
ago
when
jack
killed
our
parents
and
we
tried
to
fight
him
but
we
werent
strong
enough
to
face
him
yet
so
he
killed
her
but
at
least
that
time
i
could
bring
her
back
to
life
uh
just
like
using
a
certain
method
that
is
not
an
option
anymore
thats
the
weird
thing
about
this
for
me
im
sitting
here
looking
at
my
dead
friend
and
its
really
sad
but
at
the
same
time
all
of
this
has
already
happened
before
the
death
and
tragedy
and
stuff
getting
painted
into
the
corner
of
yet
another
unwinnable
situation
it
keeps
happening
and
i
dont
know
how
to
stop
it
