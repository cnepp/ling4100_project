what
plan
i
dunno
just
curious
about
your
spooky
ghost
plan
is
all
no
were
humans
by
which
i
mean
aliens
i
guess
i
know
right
thats
what
i
think
sometimes
its
strange
combination
of
scifi
things
like
alien
stuff
is
all
about
science
right
at
least
it
is
in
movies
aliens
love
science
but
then
ghosts
have
nothing
to
do
with
science
they
belong
to
the
supernatural
realms
which
have
more
to
do
with
religion
i
guess
or
about
a
lot
of
hocus
pocus
and
superstition
maybe
even
magic
science
rarely
enters
the
equation
unless
its
something
awesome
like
ghost
busters
which
makes
ghosts
and
stuff
all
about
science
even
though
the
ghost
science
is
obviously
a
bunch
of
total
nonsense
i
guess
contact
mixes
aliens
and
ghosts
because
jodie
foster
saw
her
ghost
dad
in
outer
space
but
then
that
was
probably
just
a
science
projection
from
an
alien
to
make
her
feel
less
sad
about
her
dead
dad
and
not
a
real
ghost
or
anything
i
guess
the
lesson
is
that
science
and
aliens
teach
us
that
ghosts
and
religion
are
fake
although
it
turns
out
ghosts
and
aliens
are
actually
real
so
maybe
science
and
religion
have
been
lying
to
us
all
along
shrug
um
yeah
sorry
what
ha
no
i
dont
even
know
her
i
kinda
thought
you
knew
who
she
was
huh
yeah
a
little
