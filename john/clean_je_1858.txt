im
glad
it
worked
out
like
this
i
was
fully
prepared
to
do
this
alone
to
hop
around
and
change
things
in
whatever
way
and
i
would
get
to
see
my
friends
again
even
if
they
dont
remember
all
the
same
stuff
i
do
which
was
a
lonely
feeling
if
that
makes
sense
but
now
ill
have
someone
else
to
remember
the
way
things
originally
went
yes
word
indeed
right
no
it
makes
sense
and
anyway
if
nothing
else
everything
that
happened
brought
us
here
the
stuff
were
about
to
do
whatever
it
is
wouldnt
be
possible
otherwise
and
that
feels
pretty
important
if
you
ask
me
