yeah
i
know
what
you
mean
when
i
try
to
think
of
what
to
fix
all
i
can
do
is
look
back
on
what
i
did
wrong
i
never
should
have
let
that
ring
out
of
my
sight
going
back
and
getting
the
ring
is
the
first
thing
we
should
do
right
i
guess
that
one
is
kind
of
a
no
brainer
besides
i
promised
roxy
id
get
it
i
kind
of
blew
it
last
time
i
told
her
id
get
it
so
maybe
i
shouldnt
mess
that
up
again
heh
what
do
you
think
terezi
but
other
than
that
the
sky
is
the
limit
really
what
do
we
do
do
i
go
back
to
when
we
were
just
starting
to
play
the
game
and
give
us
some
advantages
but
then
messing
up
our
session
causes
this
whole
chain
reaction
we
never
would
have
met
the
trolls
or
had
any
reason
to
scratch
the
session
and
if
we
didnt
scratch
the
session
there
never
would
have
been
an
alternate
reality
where
roxy
and
her
pals
got
to
play
thereby
meeting
us
when
you
start
looking
back
and
realizing
how
interrelated
everything
is
it
starts
feeling
like
an
overwhelming
job
to
fix
it
on
the
one
hand
you
dont
want
to
change
so
much
that
the
reality
you
create
is
barely
recognizable
you
want
to
keep
everything
as
similar
as
possible
so
you
get
to
keep
all
the
lessons
you
learned
and
the
important
experiences
you
had
with
your
friends
but
on
the
other
hand
if
you
arent
going
to
change
something
substantial
enough
to
make
a
real
difference
why
bother
at
all
its
like
go
big
or
go
home
you
know
sort
of
a
catch
when
you
think
about
it
is
any
of
this
making
sense
terezi
terezi
were
you
listening
to
a
word
i
said
