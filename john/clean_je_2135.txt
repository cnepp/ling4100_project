so
anyway
regardless
of
how
you
feel
about
yourself
or
whatever
thing
a
rude
troll
may
have
to
say
i
think
you
are
very
cute
even
though
you
look
a
lot
like
your
terrible
brother
the
fact
that
you
are
nice
inside
makes
a
huge
difference
i
think
that
when
youre
really
a
good
person
deep
down
instead
of
an
evil
jerk
the
skull
monster
look
becomes
a
lot
more
charming
yeah
hes
garbage
im
really
sorry
you
had
to
grow
up
with
him
i
roughed
him
up
a
bit
though
so
its
all
good
ripped
up
his
cape
pretty
good
too
not
anymore
hey
look
there
it
is
heh
nice
the
ring
i
helped
track
it
down
through
time
for
roxy
so
she
could
give
it
to
you
its
so
cool
to
see
that
it
works
you
must
be
a
really
good
friend
to
her
for
her
to
want
to
bring
you
back
so
much
nah
not
really
i
had
to
save
the
ring
anyway
and
it
just
seemed
like
the
right
thing
to
do
giving
it
to
her
since
she
was
so
worried
about
you
it
should
be
a
nice
thing
that
is
between
her
and
you
im
just
a
middle
man
anyway
its
really
nice
to
meet
the
person
who
finally
gets
to
wear
the
highly
touted
ghost
ring
it
probably
means
you
are
pretty
special
to
end
up
with
it
what
do
you
think
you
will
do
with
your
life
now
that
youre
alive
and
free
from
your
jerky
bro
well
dont
sweat
it
youll
have
a
lot
of
time
to
figure
it
out
thats
kind
of
the
point
of
life
right
to
take
a
lot
of
time
floundering
around
figuring
stuff
out
the
answer
will
come
to
you
eventually
you
should
just
try
to
have
fun
