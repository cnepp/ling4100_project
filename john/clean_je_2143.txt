what
do
you
think
they
are
talking
about
over
there
yeah
i
guess
we
should
just
chill
out
and
give
them
a
moment
it
isnt
quite
time
to
head
to
our
battle
stations
yet
so
we
might
as
well
try
to
relax
until
it
is
heheh
yeah
it
probably
is
maybe
you
should
try
not
to
let
her
bug
you
rose
she
seems
harmless
enough
plus
shes
pretty
funny
hey
ive
bumped
into
other
johns
a
few
times
cant
say
the
experience
has
been
anything
other
than
perfectly
agreeable
p
yes
wow
that
sounds
great
i
dunno
guess
you
guys
are
just
luckier
than
me
what
do
you
mean
i
dont
think
being
the
real
rose
necessarily
means
being
the
one
who
is
more
outgoing
and
chatty
and
powerful
and
stuff
im
not
sure
it
means
anything
i
think
maybe
we
should
try
to
drop
the
stuff
about
who
is
the
real
version
of
who
anyway
its
weird
and
it
just
hurts
peoples
feelings
i
really
dont
think
she
is
that
threatening
to
you
believe
me
you
still
seem
like
the
rose
i
always
knew
whereas
she
doesnt
quite
it
seems
to
me
she
is
a
lot
more
interested
in
having
fun
and
zipping
around
like
a
silly
lunatic
than
usurping
you
as
the
main
rose
but
why
do
you
care
i
thought
i
heard
the
other
rose
say
before
she
was
a
cat
that
she
liked
the
idea
of
being
some
sort
of
backup
rose
do
you
not
feel
that
way
too
step
up
hahaha
oh
my
god
nothing
i
just
missed
you
so
much
