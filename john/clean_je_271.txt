hi
karkat
oh
man
this
is
it
isnt
it
ive
been
looking
forward
to
this
no
i
mean
this
is
the
first
conversation
between
us
from
your
perspective
right
yeah
lots
of
times
actually
i
should
introduce
myself
properly
hi
karkat
i
am
because
we
are
buddies
yup
we
totally
are
we
just
became
earth
human
buddies
in
a
kind
of
weird
way
you
decide
to
keep
talking
to
me
backwards
through
my
adventure
and
then
when
you
are
done
with
that
you
come
back
and
talk
to
me
more
recently
on
the
timeline
for
a
while
you
talk
to
my
friends
a
whole
bunch
too
you
and
your
alternian
troll
buddies
help
me
and
my
earth
human
buddies
hatch
a
plan
which
we
are
busy
putting
into
motion
right
now
as
you
can
see
yeah
yeah
i
know
you
mean
the
scratch
yes
that
is
the
plan
you
yourself
said
it
was
the
only
hope
now
heheheh
egbert
man
i
knoooow
none
of
this
is
news
to
me
karkat
but
to
be
quite
honest
it
doesnt
sound
like
your
intentions
were
all
that
great
wanting
to
be
tyrants
and
all
maybe
you
got
what
you
deserved
you
stutid
fuckass
eh
its
an
injoke
never
mind
anyway
hey
i
thought
this
was
supposed
to
be
the
conversation
where
you
do
all
that
amaaaaazing
trolling
come
on
bro
flame
me
i
have
been
really
excited
about
this
um
i
dont
know
probably
not
i
just
think
its
kind
of
funny
when
you
do
it
right
about
what
ha
ha
i
dont
hate
you
wait
are
you
saying
that
we
are
kismewhatevers
er
uh
well
i
just
didnt
really
have
any
idea
that
you
had
any
sort
of
feelings
like
that
so
i
am
kind
of
caught
off
guard
hey
i
dont
have
a
problem
with
your
weird
sort
of
alien
hatelove
thing
it
is
just
that
uh
i
am
not
a
homosexual
it
is
like
when
a
boy
likes
another
boy
or
i
guess
hates
in
this
case
yes
shrug
it
just
is
i
am
just
as
confused
by
your
troll
shenanigans
so
many
shenanigans
anyway
i
kind
of
got
the
impression
that
you
and
terezi
were
a
thing
like
i
dunno
going
on
weird
fight
dates
and
beating
the
crap
out
of
each
other
and
being
in
hatelove
or
lovehate
isnt
that
how
it
works
ew
um
i
talked
to
you
and
her
and
some
others
i
dont
know
like
i
said
its
just
a
sense
i
got
sorry
oh
god
the
quadrants
ok
sheesh
karkat
i
am
going
to
be
honest
this
first
conversation
is
not
going
how
i
thought
it
would
at
all
it
is
really
kind
of
awkward
yeah
well
um
yeah
well
we
never
really
talked
about
it
in
the
past
so
i
guess
we
do
agree
to
that
told
you
bro
hahahaha
you
mean
platonic
hate
oh
yeah
oh
boy
this
sounds
great
but
were
out
of
time
i
have
to
go
put
this
plan
into
motion
d
see
you
soon
