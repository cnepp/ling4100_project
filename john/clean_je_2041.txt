you
know
jake
at
first
you
seemed
pretty
shy
but
you
dont
really
seem
that
way
at
all
now
you
just
strike
me
as
a
nice
regular
dude
who
likes
movies
and
stuff
im
glad
we
are
getting
a
chance
to
talk
heh
yeah
it
is
a
lot
of
people
im
having
trouble
keeping
track
of
everyone
myself
how
were
you
picturing
it
yes
i
dont
think
youre
wrong
though
well
i
dont
know
we
just
met
what
could
i
know
about
you
other
than
what
you
tell
me
i
believe
you
about
all
that
really
it
just
sounds
to
me
like
you
are
going
through
a
lot
of
changes
changes
are
good
especially
if
you
understand
thats
whats
happening
to
you
i
think
thats
how
we
grow
and
stuff
i
think
ive
changed
in
a
lot
of
ways
some
ways
that
werent
easy
sure
so
youre
realizing
you
like
being
by
yourself
it
sounds
like
big
deal
i
like
being
alone
a
lot
of
times
too
it
helps
me
think
if
thats
who
you
are
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
jades
grandpa
liked
being
by
himself
too
so
much
so
that
he
moved
to
an
island
as
far
away
from
civilization
as
possible
but
he
still
did
adventurous
stuff
and
was
super
successful
and
also
raised
a
cool
grand
daughter
who
was
actually
his
daughter
and
i
guess
also
yours
and
if
nothing
else
at
least
you
have
a
cool
costume
hell
yes
i
wouldnt
worry
about
that
i
love
the
god
tier
pajamas
and
yours
are
badass
you
look
like
a
super
hero
yes
well
maybe
a
plucky
side
kick
at
least
side
kicks
are
really
under
rated
anyway
i
think
in
some
cases
they
might
be
the
real
stars
like
you
know
bat
man
truth
be
told
i
think
he
might
just
be
some
kind
of
gallivanting
idiot
hes
got
all
the
money
and
skills
in
the
world
and
what
does
he
do
he
buys
a
fancy
car
to
drive
around
in
then
jumps
out
and
starts
punching
crooks
with
his
bare
hands
then
when
he
gets
horn
swoggled
by
a
wily
clown
with
no
powers
and
a
lot
less
money
who
has
to
bail
him
out
his
side
kick
of
course
what
is
bat
man
even
trying
to
prove
being
all
serious
and
cool
looking
his
side
kick
looks
like
he
has
a
lot
more
fun
and
smacks
of
confidence
and
self
assurance
trotting
around
in
his
underpants
bat
man
probably
doesnt
even
care
much
about
stopping
crime
its
more
about
walloping
thugs
and
getting
to
feel
cool
if
he
really
cared
about
stopping
bad
guys
hed
probably
use
his
fancy
money
to
buy
guns
and
at
least
show
the
criminals
hes
packing
to
make
them
scared
if
not
surrender
outright
i
bet
his
side
kick
probably
just
has
to
wait
for
bat
man
to
bungle
things
up
with
his
stupid
karate
and
when
he
gets
in
trouble
the
side
kick
just
guns
down
all
the
crooks
from
a
safe
distance
like
a
sensible
person
see
there
you
go
youre
better
than
bat
man
already
hold
on
shh
listen
ha
ha
hes
talking
to
the
mayor
again
i
just
love
how
he
talks
to
the
mayor
its
like
he
made
up
this
whole
language
of
like
minimal
talking
and
hand
gestures
its
so
cute
no
i
wasnt
eavesdropping
you
just
happened
to
be
like
right
there
and
youre
a
really
loud
whisperer
