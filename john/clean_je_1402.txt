i
have
to
be
honest
years
ago
when
we
first
talked
it
was
a
lot
of
fun
to
get
to
know
you
and
i
admit
i
thought
about
you
a
lot
since
then
but
i
guess
i
never
quite
realized
how
little
i
actually
understood
you
during
this
crazy
treasure
quest
i
tried
to
reserve
judgment
like
maybe
it
was
just
a
troll
thing
i
didnt
get
but
seeing
how
those
other
guys
felt
about
it
i
think
its
more
complicated
than
that
obviously
not
all
trolls
are
like
you
and
i
know
im
not
maybe
this
was
all
for
a
good
cause
but
it
still
felt
like
a
pretty
fucked
up
way
to
go
about
it
and
all
im
saying
is
im
ready
to
go
ive
seen
enough
and
i
miss
my
friends
ill
think
about
what
to
do
with
the
ring
but
honestly
again
i
am
just
keeping
it
real
but
if
i
am
really
thinking
hard
about
who
i
should
bring
back
to
life
i
dunno
if
my
conscience
can
justify
bringing
back
someone
so
dangerous
