wow
shes
really
down
for
the
count
isnt
she
i
got
a
lot
of
extra
punching
practice
in
my
fight
with
the
skull
jerk
maybe
i
gained
a
bit
too
much
man
grit
for
my
own
good
yes
i
randomly
appeared
and
knocked
vriska
out
cold
just
like
the
scarf
told
me
to
um
this
one
no
no
i
mean
yeah
it
was
supposed
to
go
that
way
originally
but
now
it
doesnt
have
to
because
of
like
weird
retcon
magic
and
also
your
crazy
mind
schemes
yes
well
you
from
years
in
the
future
just
before
you
died
i
got
help
from
your
older
possibly
wiser
self
you
helped
me
come
back
here
using
the
mysteries
of
the
mind
what
shut
up
no
