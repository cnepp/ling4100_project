its
ok
though
it
already
happened
i
was
sort
of
tricked
into
sleeping
on
my
quest
bed
and
when
i
went
to
sleep
jack
killed
me
she
must
have
known
that
would
happen
vriska
do
you
know
her
she
is
pretty
cool
but
just
between
you
and
me
she
might
be
a
little
crazy
but
i
dont
think
its
really
like
that
honestly
i
think
dying
was
a
necessary
part
of
the
process
and
she
just
didnt
tell
me
so
i
wouldnt
get
scared
well
i
died
on
the
quest
bed
and
woke
up
here
as
my
dream
self
and
now
i
have
all
these
sweet
wind
powers
which
is
how
i
am
making
this
car
fly
yeah
maybe
or
he
was
just
being
some
sort
of
aloof
coolkid
yeah
hmm
i
have
no
idea
maybe
you
shouldnt
rule
it
out
though
i
mean
you
did
mention
your
dream
self
isnt
completely
dead
remember
heheh
she
was
that
bad
huh
ok
i
will
not
pry
