jade
is
not
answering
are
you
sure
shes
ok
oh
you
mean
carcino
geneticist
heheh
car
cat
that
is
how
i
am
saying
that
beep
beep
meow
i
will
have
to
remember
to
give
him
a
hard
time
about
that
it
is
really
not
hard
to
do
that
i
never
even
saw
prospit
aside
from
flaming
bits
and
pieces
of
it
i
guess
something
happened
and
it
blew
up
and
dream
jade
died
and
then
i
was
wandering
around
this
place
that
was
like
a
chess
board
with
a
huge
crater
in
it
with
loads
of
dead
black
and
white
guys
everywhere
oh
huh
my
dad
was
there
um
you
know
my
guardian
yes
if
by
hive
you
mean
house
um
these
observations
are
very
alien
of
you
but
thats
pretty
cool
i
guess
seeing
as
you
are
an
alien
the
funny
thing
is
he
is
not
even
really
my
dad
i
mean
i
was
adopted
by
him
although
we
are
not
actually
unrelated
i
think
he
is
the
son
of
my
grandmother
who
isnt
really
my
grandmother
nanna
is
sort
of
like
my
biological
mother
and
my
biological
father
would
be
jades
grandpa
sorta
both
of
which
i
just
created
with
slime
and
stuff
and
sent
back
in
time
as
babies
so
i
guess
if
anything
that
makes
my
dad
my
half
brother
tell
me
about
it
