im
still
kinda
confused
though
i
mean
we
crashed
through
that
giant
window
you
magically
made
with
witch
powers
to
escape
the
scratch
so
we
can
keep
existing
right
i
see
did
you
at
least
make
it
huge
with
witch
powers
so
i
guess
thats
what
witch
powers
do
is
make
things
huge
right
like
you
did
with
all
those
planets
man
spacey
witch
powers
sound
a
lot
more
versatile
than
my
powers
frankly
not
that
im
complaining
because
wind
powers
are
still
awesome
but
anyway
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
what
im
wondering
is
once
we
crashed
through
that
window
werent
we
supposed
to
like
enter
a
new
game
session
the
reset
one
and
meet
up
with
karkat
and
vriska
and
all
the
trolls
and
i
guess
maybe
also
a
bunch
of
dead
trolls
too
like
troll
ghosts
or
such
and
what
about
your
grandson
wasnt
he
going
to
be
there
from
the
future
or
something
and
then
he
would
send
liv
tyler
to
me
or
actually
to
you
i
guess
into
the
past
somehow
wow
hey
i
wonder
what
the
fuck
ever
happened
to
liv
anyway
last
i
saw
her
i
sent
her
off
to
give
the
tumor
to
rose
and
dave
oh
god
rose
and
dave
where
are
they
now
did
one
of
them
do
the
suicide
mission
thing
and
what
about
the
other
did
they
get
scratchd
so
they
blew
up
the
sun
and
now
theyre
dead
oh
man
thats
great
i
mean
im
not
sure
how
not
blowing
up
the
sun
qualifies
as
a
successful
mission
since
that
was
kind
of
the
whole
idea
but
at
this
point
i
dont
really
care
im
just
happy
to
hear
theyre
ok
how
do
you
know
theyre
ok
or
any
of
this
stuff
really
ok
that
sounds
awesome
and
that
was
part
of
the
plan
i
guess
i
understood
but
where
is
this
new
session
all
i
see
here
is
a
bunch
of
giant
windows
and
a
lot
of
warp
speed
whooshy
nonsense
