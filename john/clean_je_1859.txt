yes
oh
yeah
i
guess
youre
right
i
didnt
even
notice
until
you
just
mentioned
it
but
yeah
i
guess
that
dumb
problem
is
finally
busted
thank
god
yes
that
was
me
too
i
was
playing
a
magic
organ
yes
see
theres
this
huge
organ
oh
shush
p
anyway
this
huge
pipe
organ
it
let
me
play
the
breeze
so
to
speak
i
think
that
was
the
only
way
to
get
rid
of
all
those
clouds
and
let
the
fire
flies
go
home
i
guess
so
i
am
surprised
by
how
my
quest
turned
out
too
to
be
honest
twinkly
who
oh
heh
