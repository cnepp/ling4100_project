there
is
not
really
much
to
see
in
this
town
but
there
are
these
lakes
this
lake
here
did
not
used
to
be
a
lake
a
long
time
ago
before
i
was
born
there
was
a
factory
here
my
dad
says
there
was
a
huge
explosion
he
was
walking
by
with
my
nanna
when
he
saw
it
then
a
little
later
my
nanna
died
my
dad
never
told
me
how
except
that
it
involved
a
big
joke
book
i
never
knew
her
which
is
too
bad
she
sounded
nice
you
did
ok
wow
really
hmm
that
all
sounds
incredible
if
true
but
i
dont
have
even
the
foggiest
memory
of
that
happening
the
tour
of
earth
