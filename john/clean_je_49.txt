ok
i
think
i
get
it
now
so
i
guess
the
battle
against
good
and
evil
is
sort
of
irrelevant
well
i
dont
know
that
all
sounds
kind
of
weird
but
in
any
case
we
build
the
house
to
get
to
these
gates
and
then
i
can
save
my
dad
and
then
after
that
we
solve
this
ultimate
riddle
thing
and
save
earth
from
destruction
