ok
where
should
i
start
you
mean
like
when
i
first
became
a
god
tier
thats
a
long
story
i
was
kind
of
tricked
into
that
it
might
take
some
setup
to
understand
alright
in
that
case
i
guess
it
all
started
on
my
thirteenth
birthday
which
was
three
years
ago
by
the
way
i
heard
about
this
awesome
game
or
at
least
one
i
thought
was
awesome
and
i
wanted
to
play
it
with
my
friends
but
it
wasnt
so
easy
to
start
i
had
to
get
it
from
the
mail
which
meant
sneaking
around
the
house
while
avoiding
my
dad
which
was
kind
of
stupid
and
childish
in
retrospect
but
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
