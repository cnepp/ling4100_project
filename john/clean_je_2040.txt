hey
mr
jake
harley
i
presume
oh
my
mistake
so
then
is
it
just
a
coincidence
that
she
had
the
same
name
as
an
invincible
super
villain
are
coincidences
even
real
ok
good
to
know
its
been
interesting
to
learn
how
even
though
we
are
all
pretty
similar
we
all
had
a
lot
of
really
different
life
details
like
there
are
all
these
things
i
take
for
granted
about
jades
childhood
which
in
theory
is
similar
to
yours
but
not
really
she
had
a
super
powerful
dog
you
didnt
have
and
also
a
grandpa
you
couldnt
have
had
because
that
was
grown
up
you
id
be
really
curious
to
hear
about
all
the
differences
in
your
life
some
time
if
you
dont
mind
hell
id
be
really
curious
to
hear
about
the
differences
in
my
altlife
so
to
speak
but
jane
is
asleep
im
guessing
she
grew
up
in
a
similar
situation
i
did
but
with
a
bunch
of
differences
guess
ill
just
have
to
wait
oh
hmm
lets
see
so
i
was
her
grandpa
instead
of
her
being
my
nanna
im
not
sure
if
that
statement
made
sense
but
you
know
what
i
mean
cool
i
never
knew
my
nanna
growing
up
except
as
an
urn
of
ashes
above
the
fireplace
i
only
met
her
as
a
sprite
was
i
dead
or
was
he
how
no
ive
heard
of
it
though
sounds
incredible
definitely
so
you
like
movies
haha
i
love
movies
too
there
are
a
whole
bunch
id
want
to
show
you
assuming
you
havent
seen
them
already
i
love
talking
about
them
with
people
i
think
my
friends
usually
just
humored
me
about
the
movies
i
liked
but
i
have
a
feeling
youd
really
dig
them
awesome
i
cant
wait
to
show
you
some
so
that
means
jane
had
an
old
man
corpse
version
of
me
around
somewhere
like
in
her
house
ok
that
sounds
pretty
preposterous
to
me
but
i
guess
she
must
have
grown
up
thinking
it
was
normal
heheh
poor
jane
ill
have
to
apologize
to
her
for
freaking
her
out
from
beyond
the
grave
what
was
her
life
like
otherwise
oh
she
lived
with
her
dad
too
do
you
know
anything
about
him
a
private
detective
wow
it
sounds
like
he
must
have
been
a
completely
different
kind
of
dad
from
the
one
i
had
all
these
differences
are
so
interesting
some
are
subtle
but
some
are
drastic
like
this
one
apparently
is
it
would
be
neat
to
meet
him
i
mean
not
that
it
would
be
much
of
a
substitute
for
getting
to
see
my
dad
again
since
theyre
totally
different
people
but
you
know
what
i
mean
do
you
know
what
happened
to
him
jail
ill
make
a
mental
note
to
check
on
him
some
time
soon
i
bet
jane
would
want
to
too
when
she
wakes
up
ill
ask
her
about
it
