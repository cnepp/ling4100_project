why
is
jade
asleep
and
also
teen
nanna
or
jane
i
mean
what
why
can
you
wake
them
up
right
you
think
oh
no
man
i
had
no
idea
i
guess
thats
what
typheus
meant
thats
so
sad
poor
jade
i
cant
believe
she
had
to
spend
all
that
time
on
the
ship
thinking
i
was
dead
i
mean
i
guess
i
was
dead
but
you
know
what
i
mean
are
you
sure
we
cant
wake
her
up
for
a
second
just
so
she
can
see
im
alright
darn
i
guess
well
have
to
catch
up
later
hey
what
about
dave
sprite
noooo
that
sucks
too
you
guess
i
dunno
ill
miss
him
anyway
even
if
he
isnt
the
real
dave
i
kinda
feel
bad
for
ever
thinking
of
him
as
a
less
real
version
actually
yeah
that
is
whats
important
i
guess
there
will
be
time
to
reflect
on
everything
that
was
lost
later
like
dead
time
clones
and
double
dead
ghosts
or
other
such
hogwash
right
now
im
still
so
excited
to
see
everybody
theres
so
much
crazy
stuff
for
us
all
to
catch
up
on
i
dont
even
know
where
to
start
its
overwhelming
what
do
you
mean
ok
that
sounds
great
