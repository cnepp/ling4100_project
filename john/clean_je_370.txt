yessssssss
i
knew
it
no
it
would
look
so
stupid
i
thought
you
didnt
want
to
get
sidetracked
anyway
putting
me
to
sleep
and
landing
me
in
hot
water
is
one
thing
but
you
sort
of
indirectly
caused
a
much
bigger
problem
before
i
fell
asleep
i
was
about
to
prototype
something
really
ridiculous
to
make
jack
weaker
i
am
pretty
sure
that
it
would
have
made
jack
lose
both
eyes
both
arms
and
give
him
silly
blue
hair
and
possibly
also
make
him
be
a
girl
he
probably
would
have
been
pretty
easy
to
beat
but
instead
it
was
prototyped
by
jades
first
guardian
dog
lusus
and
now
he
is
unstoppable
and
he
becomes
the
one
who
is
stirrin
up
all
that
trouble
in
your
session
too
i
mean
it
sounds
like
your
intentions
were
good
but
you
probably
didnt
realize
to
what
extent
you
were
messing
everything
up
what
vriska
why
would
you
do
that
but
no
why
should
i
calm
down
when
you
just
said
you
deliberately
sabotaged
all
of
us
but
what
does
that
mean
i
dont
know
if
that
makes
sense
i
mean
it
kind
of
does
but
something
doesnt
really
add
up
about
it
if
you
knew
he
was
going
to
be
created
regardless
of
what
anyone
did
why
did
you
decide
to
involve
yourself
that
way
like
the
way
you
are
involving
yourself
with
me
becoming
a
hero
or
whatever
augh
but
whyyyyyyyy
