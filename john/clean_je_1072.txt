yeah
i
know
i
mean
i
thought
i
did
its
been
kind
of
a
long
time
since
i
last
saw
it
i
really
remember
it
being
a
lot
better
than
this
but
now
everything
just
seems
so
cheesy
and
stupid
i
dont
know
im
trying
to
like
it
i
want
to
like
it
i
want
to
feel
the
same
magic
that
was
there
all
the
other
times
i
watched
it
but
i
cant
because
its
just
not
good
but
i
did
take
it
seriously
i
guess
maybe
thats
kind
of
the
point
i
always
thought
all
this
hokey
bullshit
was
legitimately
awesome
and
compelling
what
was
i
even
thinking
well
maybe
later
ill
be
able
to
rekindle
some
nostalgic
feelings
about
it
but
right
now
i
just
feel
like
a
dope
for
talking
this
up
so
hard
its
just
non
stop
terrible
action
movie
cliches
