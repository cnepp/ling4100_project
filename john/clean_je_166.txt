what
point
oh
man
i
must
be
getting
closer
to
the
conversations
where
youre
trolling
me
harder
this
is
pretty
exciting
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
youve
got
up
your
sleeve
anyway
you
werent
making
a
point
about
the
ultimate
riddle
dude
nope
we
never
talked
about
it
yet
oh
youre
just
starting
to
figure
that
out
now
oh
my
god
i
know
youve
already
told
me
like
a
million
times
man
ive
got
to
say
im
a
little
disappointed
by
this
masterful
trolling
you
were
bragging
about
maybe
but
that
would
be
pretty
weak
too
w
e
so
what
was
the
case
in
point
you
were
making
anyway
whoa
i
am
wait
these
are
baby
versions
of
us
well
i
saw
footage
of
my
nanna
and
some
other
people
who
i
am
pretty
sure
were
like
jades
grandpa
and
roses
mom
and
stuff
from
a
long
time
ago
and
then
there
were
all
these
little
guys
scurrying
around
so
they
are
like
cloned
copies
of
us
huh
what
do
you
mean
they
are
literally
us
do
they
go
back
in
time
what
is
the
riddle
anyway
maybe
i
can
guess
i
am
good
at
riddles
a
distaction
perhaps
nevermind
ok
well
if
i
run
into
some
salamanders
who
tell
me
all
about
this
riddle
and
get
really
excited
about
it
i
will
try
to
act
surprised
so
this
is
the
same
kind
of
thing
you
went
through
with
like
being
your
own
paradox
clones
and
creating
your
own
parents
and
stuff
how
did
that
even
work
with
of
you
huh
yeah
i
guess
now
that
you
mention
it
i
am
finding
it
all
a
little
strange
no
no
i
mean
the
ghost
stuff
and
paradoxes
are
one
thing
of
course
its
something
else
its
just
this
is
really
weird
well
normally
humans
hatch
from
like
these
slimy
pods
then
we
wriggle
out
as
a
little
pink
larva
hehehehehehehe
um
sure
hey
i
have
an
idea
why
dont
you
get
back
to
me
in
a
few
minutes
i
mean
like
a
few
minutes
of
my
time
not
yours
all
of
these
little
pink
monkeys
are
getting
way
out
of
line
and
i
have
to
tend
to
them
if
you
message
me
in
a
couple
minutes
we
can
continue
conversing
in
a
sane
linear
fashion
for
a
change
and
then
after
that
you
can
keep
going
backwards
and
then
make
fun
of
me
riding
my
little
red
rocket
you
can
tell
me
i
look
like
a
silly
little
paradox
clone
fresh
out
of
my
slime
tube
and
this
is
just
all
a
big
nurseytime
recess
jamboree
that
would
burn
me
good
hehehehehehehehehehehe
