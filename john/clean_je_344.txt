ok
we
have
minutes
and
seconds
why
would
it
be
significant
numbers
dont
always
need
to
have
significance
ok
well
the
number
is
now
less
than
it
was
and
therefore
less
significant
and
by
less
i
mean
more
you
had
better
hurry
upstairs
and
make
your
special
item
hey
what
do
you
think
we
should
prototype
this
fussy
little
orb
with
heheheh
it
seems
like
so
long
ago
that
rose
fed
mine
a
clown
we
were
just
messing
around
we
didnt
even
know
what
we
were
doing
yeah
its
almost
like
your
grandpa
put
all
this
crap
here
knowing
wed
have
to
make
that
decision
he
seems
like
he
was
an
awesome
guy
i
would
have
liked
to
have
the
chance
to
talk
to
him
oh
huh
wait
are
you
saying
we
will
prototype
him
like
i
did
with
nanna
to
bring
her
ghost
back
to
life
as
another
ghost
i
guess
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense
actually
yeah
also
he
brought
back
himself
from
the
future
who
wasnt
dead
but
was
going
to
die
maybe
i
dunno
specifically
to
save
my
life
as
well
as
yours
i
think
yes
its
pretty
neat
i
guess
i
just
messaged
him
he
is
not
answering
ehhh
hes
fine
he
has
been
doing
a
lot
of
time
traveling
i
talked
to
him
from
the
future
so
he
must
be
ok
now
to
make
it
that
far
yes
that
is
why
we
need
to
get
you
in
the
loop
the
loop
being
the
game
hurry
upstairs
your
transporty
pad
thingies
take
you
straight
up
right
oh
wait
what
do
we
do
about
prototyping
we
shouldnt
put
your
grandpa
in
yet
unless
we
want
lots
of
imps
and
ogres
and
stuff
that
look
like
your
grandpa
we
could
put
in
something
really
lame
to
make
all
the
monsters
weaker
or
at
the
very
least
more
ridiculous
looking
like
one
of
these
weird
pictures
of
blue
ladies
lying
around
whats
the
deal
with
those
anyway
i
guess
we
could
just
put
nothing
in
and
see
what
happens
i
dont
see
why
not
maybe
i
will
ask
rose
because
she
suddenly
understands
everything
for
some
reason
we
have
ten
minutes
to
think
about
it
whoops
i
mean
a
lot
less
than
ten
minutes
hurry
upstairs
go
go
go
