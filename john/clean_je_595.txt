this
is
my
green
slime
ghost
pogo
ride
in
all
its
glory
in
my
childhood
it
was
hours
of
fun
and
hundreds
of
painful
injuries
nope
um
not
really
humans
just
dont
really
have
much
use
for
slime
i
guess
honestly
i
cant
think
of
a
single
practical
use
for
slime
other
than
to
be
gross
anyway
this
thing
is
kind
of
a
death
trap
and
i
havent
ridden
it
for
years
i
think
my
dad
had
it
installed
as
one
of
his
ridiculous
ways
of
making
a
man
out
of
me
yeah
parents
right
haha
anyway
thats
my
back
yard
pretty
damn
boring
sorry
i
would
show
you
inside
but
i
dont
think
my
dad
would
take
too
kindly
to
bringing
an
alien
inside
or
just
yet
i
would
need
to
brace
him
for
it
i
could
show
you
around
my
neighborhood
if
you
want
