being
friendly

off
by
it
all
hanging
on
our
every

p
uh

i
actually
do
agree
it
does
sound
pretty
awkward
to
be
around
dave

his
bro

each
other
i

im
not

how
well
dave
really
even
knew
his
adult
bro
actually
aside
from
bogusly
idolizing
him
in
a
way
that
was
really
transparent
that
he
didnt
i
wonder

wonder
how
different

at
all
what

think
rose
i
hope
daves
ok
