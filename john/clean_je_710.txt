oh
man
rose
and
dave
have
sweet
god
tier
pajamas
like
us
thats
so
awesome
haha
dave
looks
like
kind
of
a
doofus
with
that
snug
little
hood
thats
true
i
still
think
i
prefer
my
outfit
though
look
at
all
those
trolls
there
are
so
many
trolls
the
idea
of
meeting
them
all
is
kind
of
overwhelming
i
wonder
which
one
is
which
i
think
that
must
have
been
karkat
there
and
that
was
probably
his
clown
asshole
friend
he
mentioned
too
and
that
was
definitely
terezi
with
the
fancy
glasses
not
sure
about
the
others
i
wonder
if
vriska
was
there
its
nice
to
see
rose
looks
better
last
time
i
saw
her
she
looked
really
grim
and
also
dark
i
was
trying
to
talk
to
her
but
she
sounded
like
a
babbling
monster
so
i
couldnt
understand
her
it
was
really
frustrating
and
all
of
my
nervous
rambling
probably
made
me
sound
like
an
idiot
and
then
when
i
woke
up
later
she
was
dead
did
you
know
that
i
had
to
kiss
her
to
make
her
come
back
to
life
yes
its
true
its
kind
of
weird
kissing
a
dead
body
but
i
didnt
mind
how
did
you
feel
about
it
when
you
kissed
dave
when
he
died
karkat
told
me
do
you
think
that
all
of
our
unbridled
corpse
smooching
means
karkats
silly
shipping
prophecy
will
come
true
i
mean
the
guy
is
really
angry
and
says
fuck
like
in
practically
every
sentence
but
he
does
weirdly
seem
to
know
what
hes
talking
about
when
it
comes
to
romance
man
i
dont
know
do
you
hmm
indeed
yeah
theres
a
lot
i
want
to
tell
them
about
and
a
lot
i
want
to
ask
them
really
