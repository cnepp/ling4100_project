you
did
oh
well
that
sure
is
convenient
where
is
he
oh
wow
jade
what
if
they
get
married
or
something
oh
god
if
rose
became
my
sister
too
that
would
wreak
havoc
on
karkats
shipping
diagram
as
leader
of
this
team
i
submit
that
we
cannot
afford
to
let
this
happen
everyone
man
your
battle
stations
we
have
a
ship
to
sink
arm
torpedoes
kapchooooooooooooo
target
destroyed
b
heheh
i
am
just
joking
around
of
course
p
yes
i
agree
even
if
it
would
make
it
awkward
for
me
to
marry
rose
but
maybe
that
doesnt
matter
these
are
kind
of
special
circumstances
i
wonder
if
my
dad
and
her
mom
would
mind
us
getting
married
whoa
in
love
oh
jeez
yeah
i
guess
youre
right
um
er
argh
this
line
of
questioning
is
making
me
flustered
all
i
know
is
i
was
ordered
by
karkat
to
marry
rose
i
think
we
can
both
agree
that
it
would
be
reckless
to
look
at
a
crappy
shipping
diagram
made
by
an
alien
and
ignore
its
message
altogether
its
a
thing
of
beauty
and
it
will
save
the
human
race
yes
btw
you
will
marry
dave
true
reality
its
ok
though
i
will
not
press
you
on
your
feelings
for
him
i
already
know
you
are
totally
into
the
strider
anyway
its
all
in
the
diagram
jade
its
all
in
the
diagram
that
you
do
ok
but
anyway
who
cares
about
his
terrible
shitty
drawings
and
meddlesome
romantic
schemes
how
do
i
find
my
dad
bluh
yes
thats
a
good
idea
ill
do
that
thanks
for
the
help
jade
i
will
talk
to
you
later
