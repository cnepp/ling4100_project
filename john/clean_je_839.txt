jade
that
is
absolutely
the
shittiest
ghost
buster
i
have
ever
seen
yes
it
is
so
yes
way
jade
i
thought
you
were
going
to
take
this
game
seriously
that
is
not
a
serious
ghost
buster
no
ghost
could
possibly
fear
that
thing
it
is
not
possible
ghosts
are
known
to
be
cruel
and
mischievous
they
will
not
want
to
befriend
your
fox
man
they
will
only
want
to
cover
him
in
slime
and
then
fly
away
i
really
think
you
should
consider
redesigning
him
ok
well
if
you
want
to
turn
our
squad
into
a
fucking
joke
then
thats
your
business
argh
but
seriously
those
head
swap
options
are
for
such
noobs
i
feel
its
only
fair
to
warn
you
ok
fine
you
get
a
pass
but
only
because
you
yourself
are
a
furry
what
is
someone
messaging
you
through
the
game
who
is
it
dammit
jade
oh
dont
tell
him
any
of
our
strategies
he
is
the
enemy
um
ok
first
tell
him
we
have
strategies
then
dont
tell
him
them
oh
god
what
is
it
now
meh
hes
alright
i
guess
i
give
most
of
his
jokes
a
passing
grade
sometimes
as
high
as
a
solid
b
thats
fine
he
and
i
keep
no
secrets
oh
like
him
taking
credit
for
my
existence
isnt
so
old
by
now
hey
jade
why
do
you
still
call
him
davesprite
i
just
call
him
dave
isnt
that
easier
i
mean
he
is
dave
after
all
right
pshh
he
is
so
not
different
dude
is
just
a
magical
orange
dave
with
wings
and
also
says
caw
sometimes
