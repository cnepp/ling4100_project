like
what
he
still
raps
sometimes
i
just
thought
i
would
mention
that
trust
me
it
hasnt
well
werent
you
a
sprite
before
how
different
did
you
feel
then
oh
right
so
half
of
you
was
a
sprite
do
you
remember
what
it
was
like
being
jade
sprite
oh
really
which
ones
hmm
i
have
to
admit
i
am
a
little
disappointed
in
the
dream
bubble
thing
by
the
way
you
were
describing
it
i
really
thought
we
would
dream
about
them
on
this
trip
more
often
i
dunno
man
that
was
weeks
ago
i
think
and
then
when
i
do
dream
about
them
its
just
kind
of
weird
either
im
alone
in
my
own
memory
talking
to
figments
of
my
imagination
or
i
dream
about
someone
we
know
like
a
troll
we
have
talked
to
and
i
get
excited
but
then
it
turns
out
they
dont
know
who
i
am
its
like
a
version
of
them
that
died
before
they
ever
even
knew
us
and
its
just
kind
of
awkward
and
i
still
havent
seen
dave
or
rose
at
all
