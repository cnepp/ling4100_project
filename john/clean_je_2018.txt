this
is
really
confusing
though
assuming
youre
right
and
i
am
busted
on
having
those
feelings
and
im
not
even
saying
you
arent
but
i
thought
humans
werent
supposed
to
be
able
to
feel
stuff
like
that
like
perceive
and
feel
romantic
stuff
in
the
same
way
trolls
do
because
were
aliens
to
each
other
well
ok
humans
can
feel
the
gay
stuff
pretty
often
i
guess
i
didnt
think
we
could
feel
the
spade
stuff
though
i
dunno
i
just
thought
it
was
some
screwy
biological
difference
youre
probably
right
you
would
know
better
than
me
at
least
no
dave
i
think
im
pretty
squared
away
on
rap
at
least
for
now
p
yeah
i
believe
you
its
been
cool
though
um
probably
not
oh
right
you
dated
jade
for
a
while
so
theres
that
i
mean
dave
sprite
did
and
of
course
i
mean
the
one
from
my
time
obviously
not
the
one
from
this
time
who
died
i
guess
before
that
happened
man
that
still
just
seems
so
sad
i
guess
even
when
you
fix
things
not
everything
can
be
perfect
ok
i
guess
my
sense
was
it
was
kind
of
dramatic
overall
im
not
sure
it
was
the
best
relationship
probably
because
of
dave
sprites
uh
unique
issues
but
there
were
a
lot
of
fun
memories
ill
tell
you
about
them
some
time
maybe
when
jade
is
awake
because
im
sure
shed
want
to
know
too
