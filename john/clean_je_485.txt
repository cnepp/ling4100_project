so
what
about
jack
are
you
still
planning
on
killing
him
that
would
be
a
constructive
way
to
use
your
killer
troll
instincts
even
by
human
standards
it
is
much
better
than
killing
friends
well
we
have
a
plan
to
defeat
him
too
so
theres
that
yeah
so
will
you
go
fight
him
then
for
whatever
its
worth
coming
from
a
human
feeling
remorse
doesnt
make
you
weak
i
bet
you
are
still
really
strong
but
then
im
not
sure
if
i
actually
want
to
encourage
you
to
go
off
fighting
him
because
as
strong
as
you
probably
are
it
sounds
like
he
is
really
strong
and
even
though
you
killed
tons
of
people
i
think
i
would
still
be
pretty
sad
if
you
died
so
maybe
you
should
just
let
us
handle
it
at
least
we
wont
fight
him
directly
well
maybe
you
dont
all
of
the
luck
sounds
like
an
awful
lot
of
luck
to
have
heh
what
