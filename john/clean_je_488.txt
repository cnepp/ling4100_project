that
is
a
pretty
exciting
story
so
then
your
great
great
great
grandnanna
or
such
was
some
kind
of
troll
pirate
uh
i
mean
pir
now
that
you
mention
that
it
really
sounds
like
our
situations
are
not
so
different
i
created
our
guardians
in
the
lab
too
along
with
the
four
of
us
and
when
you
think
about
it
i
never
even
knew
my
nanna
she
died
before
i
was
born
or
uh
before
i
created
myself
and
sent
baby
me
back
in
time
i
mean
so
really
she
is
my
ancestor
too
someone
i
am
connected
to
genetically
but
never
knew
and
even
though
i
never
knew
her
she
definitely
helped
me
when
i
was
growing
up
i
followed
in
her
footsteps
and
became
an
incredible
prankster
i
even
had
a
book
i
learned
a
lot
from
too
the
book
was
sort
of
a
family
tradition
it
was
written
by
an
even
older
ancestor
my
nannas
grandpa
who
was
only
the
most
legendary
prankster
of
all
time
so
as
you
can
see
we
have
both
benefited
greatly
from
ancestral
wisdom
i
think
it
is
nice
to
see
that
when
you
take
a
closer
look
we
have
a
lot
more
in
common
than
we
first
thought
what
heheheh
yep
also
her
ashes
were
there
too
yeah
it
is
pretty
great
actually
i
highly
recommend
being
human
