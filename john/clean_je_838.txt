you
should
hurry
up
and
make
a
character
already
so
we
can
get
started
just
any
old
ghost
buster
as
long
as
he
looks
awesome
and
like
he
means
business
i
will
begin
organizing
our
squad
well
first
we
need
buy
an
old
abandoned
fire
station
to
use
as
a
headquarters
luckily
half
the
city
is
composed
of
abandoned
fire
stations
that
are
for
sale
this
game
is
actually
really
stupid
in
a
lot
of
ways
now
that
i
think
about
it
hey
shut
up
i
take
it
back
its
great
in
every
way
ok
now
i
have
to
find
us
a
mission
got
to
hire
a
sassy
secretary
just
have
to
peruse
this
extensive
palette
of
sarcastic
red
headed
ladies
ok
here
is
a
good
one
then
we
wait
for
a
phone
call
this
can
take
anywhere
from
ten
seconds
to
several
hours
but
thats
fine
theres
lots
to
do
in
the
station
to
kill
time
like
talk
to
slimer
and
get
slimed
by
slimer
ok
i
guess
thats
pretty
much
all
there
is
to
do
the
fire
pole
is
strictly
decorative
are
you
almost
finished
making
your
character
