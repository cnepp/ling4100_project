easy
i
have
a
magic
ring
yes
wait
what
do
you
mean
too
you
have
a
magic
ring
ah
no
mine
doesnt
do
that
it
brings
ghosts
back
to
life
yes
wai
way
its
back
at
my
house
i
could
go
get
it
right
now
it
is
quite
true
it
should
be
a
piece
of
cake
you
just
wear
it
when
you
go
to
sleep
and
it
comes
with
you
in
your
dreams
then
you
find
your
cherub
friend
put
it
on
her
finger
and
bring
her
back
i
think
you
can
only
use
it
once
though
so
once
shes
wearing
it
it
would
be
hers
forever
or
at
least
as
long
as
she
wants
it
sure
its
no
big
deal
really
for
a
while
i
was
hanging
on
to
it
thinking
that
i
might
give
it
to
aw
man
this
is
gong
to
sound
dumb
there
was
a
girl
who
i
was
considering
giving
it
to
for
some
reason
remember
she
was
the
diabolical
one
who
figured
prominently
in
my
long
story
yes
close
enough
see
she
really
wanted
that
ring
and
she
found
out
i
had
it
and
honestly
im
not
sure
why
it
even
crossed
my
mind
to
give
it
to
her
i
guess
i
was
just
used
to
the
idea
that
i
liked
her
for
some
reason
at
least
i
thought
i
did
it
was
a
stupid
idea
based
on
hardly
anything
like
one
day
of
conversations
but
since
ive
gotten
to
know
her
better
i
dont
know
i
think
i
might
actually
kind
of
hate
her
yeah
shes
actually
pretty
awful
shes
so
full
of
herself
and
mean
to
her
friends
and
dangerous
really
really
dangerous
yeah
it
does
anyway
i
dont
think
i
can
let
anyone
like
that
have
the
ring
no
its
funny
after
spending
some
time
with
a
person
who
is
legitimately
crazy
it
becomes
easy
to
tell
right
away
when
someone
isnt
well
yeah
everyone
is
a
little
crazy
i
just
mean
not
bad
crazy
besides
you
dont
even
want
the
ring
for
yourself
you
want
to
give
it
to
someone
you
care
about
that
is
what
makes
you
one
of
the
good
guys
what
makes
you
think
im
the
leader
haha
ok
ill
take
that
as
a
compliment
anyway
ill
go
get
the
ring
now
yeah
thats
a
good
plan
if
i
had
to
guess
id
say
you
must
be
the
leader
of
your
team
squad
too
right
yeah
but
maybe
we
can
do
something
about
that
if
we
work
together
alright
off
i
go
keep
practicing
your
powers
see
you
roxy
