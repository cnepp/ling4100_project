that
but
vriska
this
is
a
very
bizarre
and
unsettling
fact
to
me
because
man
i
dont
know
it
just
is
you
say
we
dated
for
a
while
but
like
i
dont
even
get
to
remember
doing
that
i
think
thats
mostly
whats
weird
about
it
well
can
you
at
least
tell
me
what
happened
there
like
how
did
that
go
oh
what
what
do
you
mean
he
died
you
mean
his
ghost
died
as
in
he
just
doesnt
exist
at
all
anymore
like
dead
dead
i
dont
how
does
that
even
who
killed
him
was
it
jack
he
is
not
old
news
though
hes
still
as
strong
and
menacing
as
ever
i
just
had
an
awesome
battle
with
him
in
this
very
dream
bubble
yeah
i
found
him
skulking
around
a
memory
of
my
dead
dad
and
i
got
pissed
off
so
i
really
let
him
have
it
oh
i
even
used
the
cool
hammer
you
helped
me
make
remember
that
yes
the
last
time
i
faced
him
was
kind
of
embarrassing
i
let
him
get
the
drop
on
me
and
he
just
stabbed
me
right
away
but
this
time
i
think
i
held
my
own
pretty
well
i
even
got
in
one
good
hit
against
him
i
gave
him
a
solid
bop
on
the
head
and
the
dice
roll
made
him
wear
a
silly
hat
oh
really
i
guess
so
yeah
he
sure
was
but
our
fight
was
interrupted
by
like
another
taller
white
jack
dressed
in
rags
well
no
it
wasnt
actually
a
jack
it
was
someone
different
altogether
who
just
looked
like
him
with
wings
and
a
sword
and
everything
i
think
the
white
jack
was
probably
a
girl
im
not
sure
but
that
was
my
hunch
i
didnt
talk
to
her
or
anything
she
looked
really
angry
anyway
he
seemed
scared
of
her
so
he
flew
away
and
she
chased
him
do
you
know
who
she
was
whatever
jacks
doing
out
here
in
dream
bubble
land
he
seems
to
have
his
hands
full
with
her
on
his
tail
but
as
you
can
see
he
is
far
from
out
of
the
picture
what
guy
who
