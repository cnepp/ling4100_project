ok
nanna
i
will
hey
nanna
since
i
am
trying
to
get
up
to
that
gate
and
since
you
can
sort
of
conjure
floating
beds
and
throw
me
around
and
all
couldnt
you
just
throw
me
up
to
the
gate
oh
ok
i
guess
thats
what
i
figured
so
just
one
more
thing
do
you
think
that
instead
of
telling
me
exactly
why
that
is
with
a
clear
explanation
you
can
give
me
a
series
of
really
coy
riddles
about
it
and
then
sort
of
giggle
ha
ha
i
guess
i
suddenly
understand
everything
