look
i
love
nic
cage
he
is
basically
my
hero
ok
but
im
kind
of
just
realizing
now
that
he
is
embarrassingly
bad
in
this
movie
he
is
just
doing
this
corny
parody
of
a
southern
guy
who
is
down
on
his
luck
and
acts
charming
with
his
goofy
accent
and
stuff
some
things
i
used
to
think
were
so
badass
are
just
coming
off
as
ridiculous
now
can
you
believe
that
one
time
we
were
watching
this
movie
when
he
said
put
the
bunny
back
in
the
box
i
actually
high
fived
my
dad
this
time
that
line
just
made
me
roll
my
eyes
theres
so
much
crappy
dialogue
cyrus
this
is
your
barbecue
and
it
tastes
good
arrgh
jade
please
it
was
a
cheesy
line
dont
be
so
naive
ok
im
sorry
i
guess
in
fairness
to
you
you
have
only
just
begun
to
climb
the
steep
learning
curve
of
this
vexing
and
hypnotic
film
but
i
am
no
longer
bound
by
its
spell
jade
i
am
fine
this
movie
is
whats
crappy
these
days
