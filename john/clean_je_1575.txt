your
mom
well
yeah
but
i
know
her
as
your
daughter
but
i
mean
who
the
hell
knows
at
this
point
there
is
probably
something
to
that
actually
you
were
all
the
first
batch
of
babies
after
all
i
think
you
were
literal
copies
of
yourselves
thats
what
it
supposedly
means
to
be
a
paradox
clone
oh
i
guess
i
kind
of
glossed
over
this
stuff
in
my
story
but
i
was
the
one
who
made
us
all
in
the
first
place
with
a
weird
cloning
machine
it
was
no
big
deal
though
i
was
just
messing
around
with
a
control
panel
and
some
babies
appeared
come
to
think
of
it
we
met
one
other
time
too
but
you
were
asleep
you
were
floating
around
in
purple
pajamas
and
i
pushed
you
out
of
the
way
of
a
flying
fork
i
almost
forgot
about
that
but
yep
that
was
you
alright
i
might
have
but
the
fork
stabbed
me
in
the
chest
and
dream
killed
my
sleep
ghost
or
something
you
know
how
it
is
with
dream
logic
yes
exactly
i
guess
i
didnt
think
much
about
it
at
the
time
but
i
had
a
sneaky
suspicion
thats
who
you
were
you
really
look
a
lot
like
rose
she
is
looking
for
you
by
the
way
she
told
me
to
go
find
you
and
i
did
so
she
says
hi
uh
she
said
shes
looking
forward
to
meeting
you
sure
theres
nothing
to
be
nervous
about
though
shes
just
a
nice
nerd
who
likes
to
read
and
knit
speaking
of
which
ive
been
wondering
where
he
is
i
know
jades
grandpa
is
in
jail
too
getting
badgered
by
my
evil
nanna
yes
sorry
but
i
have
not
seen
hide
nor
hair
of
daves
bro
yet
hmm
who
yes
oh
no
where
is
she
youre
right
that
is
very
concerning
who
is
she
would
i
know
of
her
oh
surprisingly
i
know
a
lot
about
that
subject
for
instance
did
you
know
they
turn
into
gigantic
snakes
when
they
have
sex
i
know
weird
right
thats
probably
not
very
relevant
to
the
topic
at
hand
though
uh
huh
ohhh
ok
this
is
starting
to
make
sense
i
understand
she
is
your
friend
i
would
feel
the
same
way
wait
a
minute
ive
got
it
i
have
such
a
good
idea
that
would
solve
your
problem
all
you
have
to
do
is
bring
her
back
to
life
