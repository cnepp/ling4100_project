oh
man
this
is
turning
into
a
stupid
circus
shh
i
should
really
get
out
of
here
the
time
line
is
already
boned
enough
as
it
is
without
me
hanging
around
i
mean
i
guess
it
doesnt
matter
that
much
if
im
here
we
already
changed
history
like
almost
completely
that
was
kind
of
the
point
vriskas
not
dead
anymore
so
that
means
wait
what
does
that
actually
mean
so
that
means
ill
never
be
able
to
get
the
life
ring
from
tavros
but
i
already
have
the
ring
so
i
guess
that
doesnt
matter
wait
does
this
really
mean
vriskas
ghost
stops
existing
or
is
her
ghost
just
going
to
keep
existing
in
the
dream
bubbles
because
of
reasons
and
if
i
never
ended
up
meeting
her
ghost
i
guess
i
never
stuck
my
hand
in
the
house
thing
to
get
the
retcon
powers
in
the
first
place
so
how
god
damn
it
