so
tell
me
about
your
ridiculous
meteor
journey
the
dave
from
the
bad
time
line
told
me
some
funny
stories
when
we
got
together
on
the
grassy
hill
planet
but
we
werent
actually
hanging
out
for
that
long
so
i
didnt
hear
much
also
im
mostly
sure
vriska
wasnt
alive
during
their
trip
haha
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
i
spent
some
time
with
her
when
she
was
a
ghost
and
uh
lets
just
say
whatever
her
mortality
status
is
she
makes
her
presence
hard
to
ignore
wow
karkat
for
a
funny
shouty
guy
you
backed
down
on
that
really
fast
im
almost
a
bit
disappointed
i
was
looking
forward
to
more
of
your
patented
ravings
oh
well
im
sold
heheh
ok
you
are
no
uh
maybe
i
dunno
it
was
a
long
time
ago
and
we
had
a
lot
of
ridiculous
conversations
no
i
mean
i
think
i
remember
i
think
you
were
um
black
flirting
with
me
or
something
but
in
backwards
order
and
while
constantly
yelling
and
i
didnt
really
even
know
what
that
was
and
then
i
told
you
i
wasnt
a
homosexual
so
it
was
kind
of
a
moot
point
but
also
you
didnt
even
know
what
that
was
either
dave
i
think
youre
making
karkat
uncomfortable
are
you
being
a
wise
guy
and
trying
to
make
us
uncomfortable
well
not
that
i
really
want
to
egg
on
this
train
of
thought
but
i
dunno
if
thats
quite
true
i
can
get
really
angry
and
hate
stuff
too
just
like
you
but
i
think
only
in
extreme
cases
the
skull
guy
in
suspenders
i
got
really
pissed
off
at
but
i
am
a
hundred
percent
sure
that
hate
was
platonic
ok
dave
it
definitely
sounds
like
youre
trying
to
own
us
now
being
able
to
hate
things
i
think
is
the
smaller
part
of
that
equation
what
about
the
other
part
dont
you
think
thats
uh
a
little
more
significant
the
part
about
not
being
a
homosexual
what
why
no
thats
a
normal
way
of
putting
it
i
mean
its
a
pretty
normal
thing
to
say
right
when
thats
how
you
are
oh
kay
so
then
youre
saying
what
are
you
saying
i
hm
like
yeah
i
dunno
it
was
pretty
funny
sometimes
it
was
just
a
lot
of
joking
around
dave
um
all
thats
cool
and
all
and
i
think
i
mostly
agree
but
ummmm
how
do
i
put
this
are
you
are
you
gay
now
i
dunno
it
sounds
to
me
like
youre
trying
tell
me
something
here
i
mean
its
ok
if
youre
gay
now
thats
totally
cool
if
true
i
just
think
you
turning
gay
would
be
kind
of
a
weird
consequence
of
me
changing
the
time
line
around
ok
not
weird
just
unexpected
i
dunno
what
i
did
that
would
account
for
that
maybe
saving
one
of
terezis
plush
toys
did
some
goofy
homosexual
butterfly
effect
thing
on
you
jeez
who
knows
thats
fine
we
can
talk
about
anything
you
want
any
time
im
just
still
confused
about
what
youre
getting
at
is
all
like
what
is
the
bottom
line
here
are
you
actually
attracted
to
boys
now
do
you
um
did
you
like
date
any
boys
but
there
werent
even
that
many
boys
on
the
meteor
well
theres
the
clown
guy
but
i
dont
really
see
you
and
him
that
really
only
leaves
um
were
you
and
karkat
are
you
and
karkat
like
hmm
