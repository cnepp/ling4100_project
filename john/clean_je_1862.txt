howd
it
go
pretty
well
id
say
i
think
so
but
i
havent
really
tried
a
controlled
jump
yet
i
have
no
idea
the
thought
of
changing
the
time
line
is
still
mind
boggling
to
me
thats
right
i
definitely
wanted
to
go
back
and
get
the
ring
off
my
couch
before
i
lost
it
at
the
very
least
that
way
you
can
use
it
to
help
your
friend
not
yet
so
much
has
happened
its
hard
to
even
think
about
and
its
not
even
limited
to
what
ive
been
through
either
ive
seen
a
lot
of
other
crazy
stuff
just
from
my
random
jumps
like
like
the
last
place
i
was
actually
just
before
i
came
back
to
find
your
session
in
ruins
haha
i
actually
got
into
a
pretty
serious
fight
with
this
guy
a
skull
kid
hes
a
huge
asshole
and
a
horrible
artist
unfortunately
in
fact
i
was
in
his
drawings
once
it
was
a
true
nightmare
come
to
life
i
am
pretty
much
convinced
he
is
the
guy
behind
all
of
the
problems
we
ever
had
even
though
he
is
a
complete
ignoramus
yeah
probably
i
have
a
feeling
some
day
we
will
all
have
to
take
him
down
but
probably
when
he
grows
up
to
be
his
adult
self
when
i
beat
him
up
he
was
just
a
teen
scamp
like
us
but
with
a
skull
for
a
head
a
robot
leg
a
cape
which
i
ripped
to
shreds
and
a
pair
of
dumb
suspenders
meh
not
particularly
i
was
just
really
angry
and
i
caught
him
off
guard
drawing
some
shitty
animes
they
were
quite
literally
the
worst
animes
i
have
ever
seen
i
hope
i
hurt
his
drawing
hand
and
he
never
does
any
more
ugly
art
for
the
rest
of
his
stupid
immortal
skull
monster
life
