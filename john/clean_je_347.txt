oh
nothing
i
am
just
dropping
monsters
all
over
the
place
that
is
all
are
you
upstairs
ok
good
i
left
the
cruxite
by
the
lathe
as
well
as
the
punched
card
with
the
green
thingy
on
it
you
should
have
plenty
of
time
to
make
it
no
drama
here
a
little
more
than
minutes
in
the
meantime
i
will
try
to
contact
rose
and
get
this
prototyping
nonsense
sorted
out
its
so
confusing
in
my
foolishness
i
came
very
close
to
prototyping
your
grandpa
we
very
nearly
had
to
face
our
grandfatherly
paradoxdad
as
a
last
boss
that
would
probably
be
the
worst
case
scenario
