it
brought
me
inside
the
palace
it
was
huge
and
it
took
a
long
time
to
explore
it
was
eerily
empty
too
i
had
that
weird
feeling
of
getting
to
a
place
in
a
video
game
you
are
not
supposed
to
be
yet
because
you
dont
have
the
right
powerups
and
such
you
know
what
i
mean
oh
ok
so
i
started
getting
crazy
nervous
the
longer
i
was
down
here
and
i
was
starting
to
wonder
if
my
silly
iron
pogo
hammer
would
even
do
any
damage
against
the
monster
what
excuse
me
it
is
called
the
wrinkle
fucker
and
it
is
totally
amazing
thats
so
absurd
like
anything
like
that
would
ever
even
happen
