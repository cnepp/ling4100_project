yes
me
i
mean
yes
wow
its
kind
of
weird
talking
to
myself
im
not
sure
if
im
a
very
big
fan
of
the
experience
but
yeah
you
should
get
going
terezis
experiment
worked
youll
find
out
all
about
it
later
actually
im
not
sure
now
that
i
changed
how
things
happened
for
you
you
might
not
get
the
idea
to
come
back
here
like
i
did
which
i
guess
makes
this
situation
a
true
paradox
unlike
all
those
lame
stable
time
loops
dave
makes
i
dont
know
what
it
means
unfortunately
you
may
not
be
relevant
anymore
im
the
who
is
learning
to
use
his
flashy
powers
to
reconstruct
the
time
line
so
that
responsibility
is
on
my
shoulders
now
not
yours
sorry
i
am
just
keeping
it
real
well
who
really
knows
how
it
will
turn
out
maybe
you
will
still
have
important
things
to
do
i
dont
have
all
the
answers
i
just
know
terezi
and
i
have
to
talk
now
so
you
should
go
where
you
were
about
to
go
anyway
go
see
typheus
and
do
the
quest
thing
it
worked
out
great
well
for
me
at
least
thats
the
spirit
