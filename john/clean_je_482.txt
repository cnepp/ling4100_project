then
what
is
it
you
did
who
was
it
you
mean
like
a
bad
guy
oh
yeah
karkat
mentioned
that
he
was
in
trouble
and
then
had
to
go
it
made
me
a
little
worried
are
you
guys
under
attack
or
something
oh
well
then
who
did
you
kill
why
well
did
he
attack
you
or
something
uh
why
did
you
have
to
wow
youre
right
vriska
that
does
not
sound
good
you
dont
what
about
all
of
your
friends
i
bet
karkat
would
listen
or
what
about
terezi
shes
pretty
nice
isnt
she
why
not
well
how
do
you
feel
oh
i
guess
i
understand
i
mean
im
trying
to
with
the
cultural
difference
and
all
like
trolls
are
more
violent
and
angry
right
kind
of
like
klingons
or
something
which
is
an
angry
race
of
alien
savages
from
a
human
tv
show
oh
i
know
thats
not
what
i
meant
but
i
am
guessing
you
all
have
to
act
tough
to
make
it
in
your
world
and
have
a
sense
of
honor
about
fighting
and
like
to
beat
people
up
and
stuff
right
but
i
think
that
no
matter
what
alien
culture
you
are
from
killing
is
still
wrong
and
it
sounds
like
you
do
too
well
you
could
try
i
am
listening
i
think
if
you
feel
bad
it
just
means
you
have
a
conscience
which
is
good
right
how
was
it
like
a
test
ok
so
you
killed
other
people
that
you
didnt
care
about
hm
how
many
or
do
i
want
to
know
uhhhhhhhh
hopy
shit
i
guess
that
is
why
you
didnt
get
along
with
her
i
see
still
that
is
a
lot
of
killing
jesus
but
then
you
finally
killed
a
guy
you
liked
and
not
so
cool
anymore
uh
i
guess
i
had
no
idea
how
different
we
really
were
what
i
am
hearing
is
seriously
scaring
the
shit
out
of
me
ok
well
i
appreciate
the
honesty
so
if
killing
isnt
exactly
wrong
then
what
is
it
what
do
you
mean
by
what
killing
really
means
