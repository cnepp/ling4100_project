who
even
cares
what
we
missed
just
cameron
stupid
poe
in
his
idiot
wife
beater
babbling
some
more
southern
home
spun
heroic
nonsense
heart
of
gold
my
ass
everything
dave
ever
said
about
this
movie
was
right
i
cant
believe
i
used
to
think
he
was
just
trolling
me
the
stupid
junkyard
scene
where
cyrus
makes
a
little
model
out
of
rocks
and
stuff
just
so
he
could
tell
the
criminals
to
surround
some
army
guys
and
shoot
them
that
was
pointless
and
all
this
heavy
handed
scoring
oh
my
god
the
music
makes
every
little
thing
into
such
a
federal
issue
like
oh
man
some
minor
characters
being
introduced
in
slow
motion
dundun
dundun
dun
dun
dun
there
now
you
officially
know
they
are
all
badasses
also
i
somehow
didnt
even
remember
dave
chappelle
being
in
this
movie
he
was
pointless
too
and
you
know
the
malloy
guy
the
dick
head
cop
who
were
supposed
to
hate
because
of
how
he
gives
cusack
a
hard
time
and
makes
asshole
decisions
with
a
helicopter
well
screw
that
he
wasnt
so
bad
so
what
if
he
was
a
little
grumpy
he
was
just
trying
to
do
his
job
he
had
one
of
the
best
lines
in
the
movie
actually
which
was
another
thing
we
were
supposed
to
hate
him
for
what
was
it
about
how
cusack
was
probably
out
saving
a
tree
and
recycling
his
sandals
or
some
shit
hahaha
now
that
i
think
about
it
i
fucking
love
malloy
im
going
to
rewind
it
to
watch
that
scene
again
oh
and
were
supposed
to
be
like
yeah
when
cusack
wrecks
malloys
awesome
sports
car
but
that
was
a
nice
car
cusack
shouldnt
have
ruined
it
like
that
for
laughs
i
know
i
wasnt
laughing
were
you
cusack
was
such
a
terrible
character
in
this
movie
now
that
i
think
about
it
i
dont
really
get
what
he
added
to
it
he
was
like
the
second
hero
but
dorkier
what
did
he
even
really
do
he
scampered
around
the
junkyard
for
a
while
goofing
off
and
then
when
it
was
his
time
to
shine
he
demonstrated
his
mastery
over
heavy
machinery
wow
he
can
operate
a
crane
i
am
thrilled
by
the
exploits
of
this
pedantic
weenie
i
guess
hes
actually
like
cages
estranged
sidekick
almost
like
the
robin
that
batman
never
realized
he
had
now
that
i
think
about
it
this
movie
was
always
an
oddly
poignant
tale
of
bromance
between
cage
and
cusack
just
two
bros
separated
by
destiny
waiting
to
be
united
when
they
finally
come
together
to
kick
some
ass
it
is
arguably
more
moving
than
when
he
reunites
with
his
wife
and
daughter
i
wonder
if
ill
think
that
scene
sucks
now
too
it
used
to
move
me
to
tears
but
now
ill
probably
think
its
so
lame
im
almost
afraid
to
watch
it
maybe
i
should
try
to
leave
at
least
some
memories
untainted
yeah
right
crazy
like
a
fowww
oh
i
guess
there
was
a
stray
feather
clinging
to
my
pajamas
and
it
just
poked
me
in
the
ass
