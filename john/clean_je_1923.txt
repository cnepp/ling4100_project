i
dont
know
if
this
makes
sense
but
when
we
all
came
together
like
this
out
of
the
blue
and
had
our
long
awaited
reunion
im
not
sure
if
we
really
earned
it
yet
we
didnt
realize
it
at
the
time
but
there
were
still
a
bunch
of
problems
waiting
to
happen
like
some
lingering
issues
that
were
going
to
pull
us
all
apart
again
and
make
us
fight
to
get
back
together
once
and
for
all
but
dont
worry
im
working
to
overcome
all
those
problems
right
now
thats
why
im
here
its
also
why
i
cant
hang
around
all
day
babbling
like
a
fool
i
really
need
to
quit
yapping
and
hit
the
road
