oh
hey
terezi
guess
our
plan
worked
out
pretty
well
huh
this
session
is
in
much
better
shape
than
the
last
time
i
saw
it
you
really
bailed
us
out
i
mean
not
that
you
specifically
had
anything
to
do
with
it
you
were
as
much
the
beneficiary
of
your
future
selfs
crafty
schemes
as
i
was
so
dont
get
too
smug
pff
ok
whatever
you
say
oh
that
reminds
me
i
know
the
scarf
agenda
wasnt
really
your
idea
per
se
but
do
you
have
any
idea
what
all
that
stuffed
dragon
shit
was
about
did
that
like
actually
serve
a
purpose
in
the
time
line
or
were
you
just
fucking
with
me
