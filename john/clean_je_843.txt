yes
what
is
your
point
oh
man
jade
listen
at
this
point
i
could
not
give
less
of
a
rats
ass
about
romancey
stuff
i
would
rather
just
play
some
games
and
chill
out
for
several
years
on
this
magical
flying
boat
is
that
too
much
to
ask
when
i
catch
up
with
our
buddies
im
sure
i
will
give
rose
a
nice
friendly
hug
whereas
i
will
offer
dave
a
tender
bro
embrace
and
shove
karkat
down
a
flight
of
friendship
stairs
but
that
is
it
its
all
very
complicated
and
bothersome
jade
you
know
matters
of
the
heart
ok
you
may
laugh
at
my
choice
of
words
but
it
is
true
its
really
befuddling
and
distracting
when
you
are
on
a
major
quest
to
make
universes
out
of
frogs
who
even
needs
it
like
you
remember
that
troll
girl
who
was
sort
of
into
me
well
ok
that
seemed
like
a
pretty
big
deal
at
the
time
it
really
seemed
like
she
liked
me
but
also
she
was
probably
insane
like
i
mean
in
a
trollish
murderous
kind
of
way
but
craziness
notwithstanding
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
think
i
guess
i
thought
she
was
cool
at
the
time
i
was
honestly
kind
of
flummoxed
about
it
but
the
point
is
when
all
was
said
and
done
that
was
just
some
stuff
that
happened
over
one
day
which
was
a
whole
year
ago
already
i
barely
even
remember
what
we
talked
about
by
the
time
we
meet
up
she
probably
wont
give
a
shit
about
me
at
all
which
lets
face
it
is
probably
for
the
best
i
think
we
make
things
more
meaningful
in
our
head
when
theyre
happening
than
they
really
are
like
realistically
there
were
probably
a
lot
of
things
that
went
on
that
day
that
didnt
mean
that
much
like
remember
how
you
said
you
thought
karkat
was
getting
this
silly
angry
crush
on
you
yeah
i
mean
do
you
really
think
after
three
years
he
is
still
going
to
have
the
rage
hots
for
you
i
dont
think
even
he
is
that
crazy
anyway
my
point
is
who
even
cares
about
all
that
romance
and
dating
are
dumb
and
boring
we
are
legendary
heroes
and
we
have
bigger
fish
to
fry
like
that
smug
fatass
over
there
on
the
horizon
he
sure
looks
pleased
with
himself
just
look
at
him
he
thinks
he
is
the
undisputed
king
of
that
mountain
or
something
follow
me
so
we
can
seize
the
high
ground
against
this
hideous
ocean
dwelling
marshmallow
man
and
steal
all
of
his
treasure
