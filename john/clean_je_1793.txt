i
guess
you
have
a
point
would
that
actually
accomplish
anything
though
uh
more
or
less
i
think
their
purpose
is
a
bit
more
mysterious
than
that
and
i
guess
more
like
majestic
i
dont
know
im
probably
not
the
best
guy
to
ask
about
denizens
jade
met
hers
but
shes
a
sprite
could
explain
it
better
than
me
didnt
you
ever
talk
to
your
sprite
about
them
you
did
wow
what
kind
of
sprite
did
you
even
have
er
never
mind
i
did
not
mean
to
touch
upon
yet
another
sad
subject
anyway
maybe
youre
right
and
my
denizen
could
help
me
with
these
problems
but
at
the
same
time
there
are
so
many
problems
even
if
i
learned
to
control
my
powers
better
we
would
still
have
to
deal
with
all
this
glitchy
bullshit
i
could
zap
around
and
fix
everything
but
if
its
all
still
garbled
how
would
i
even
know
it
was
fixed
maybe
you
were
right
roxy
what
if
its
all
too
much
to
overcome
this
time
even
for
typheus
