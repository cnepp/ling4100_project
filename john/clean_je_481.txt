oh
hey
there
vriska
can
this
wait
i
was
about
to
check
out
this
castle
and
see
if
my
dad
is
here
oh
dang
it
do
you
know
where
they
are
argh
how
much
later
well
ok
i
guess
so
shrug
pshhh
i
dont
know
if
it
is
much
of
a
major
accomplishment
honestly
um
no
i
guess
i
just
miss
my
dad
i
was
hoping
he
would
be
here
but
apparently
i
wont
see
him
for
another
few
hours
or
whatever
if
that
is
what
you
see
in
the
future
then
i
guess
theres
no
fighting
it
bluh
yeah
i
know
i
guess
you
just
have
to
think
of
them
the
way
you
think
of
your
lusus
ses
lusi
that
is
too
bad
no
why
would
i
be
mad
at
you
vriska
oh
right
i
actually
almost
forgot
about
that
why
would
you
need
to
apologize
though
i
mean
i
admit
i
was
pretty
confused
about
it
at
first
seeing
my
dead
body
in
the
cloud
and
all
but
in
the
end
you
did
it
to
help
me
didnt
you
really
i
should
probably
be
thanking
you
uh
are
you
there
heh
i
really
dont
know
what
reason
i
would
have
to
be
angry
i
mean
aside
from
the
deception
involved
but
i
kinda
understand
why
you
did
that
and
in
any
case
you
did
give
me
a
choice
shruuuuuuuug
so
is
that
what
you
wanted
to
talk
to
me
about
