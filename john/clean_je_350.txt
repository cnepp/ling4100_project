happened
yes
i
know
on
the
corner
of
my
ghost
bed
in
the
middle
of
an
oil
ocean
for
some
reason
um
i
have
no
idea
i
dont
remember
what
happened
i
was
in
the
middle
of
helping
jade
and
then
i
guess
my
bed
crashed
and
i
got
knocked
out
i
guess
i
was
dreaming
i
couldnt
have
been
out
for
that
long
because
my
dream
was
really
short
i
was
on
the
battlefield
again
but
i
did
not
have
time
to
seek
the
treasure
but
i
did
see
a
black
guy
wrapped
up
in
my
ghosty
bed
sheets
he
was
acting
very
suspicious
oh
i
do
not
mean
like
an
african
american
or
anything
like
bill
cosby
r
i
p
bill
this
fellow
had
a
hard
black
shell
like
all
the
dead
guys
do
i
followed
him
for
a
bit
and
then
some
sorta
ruckus
transpired
and
i
woke
up
and
now
jade
wont
answer
do
you
know
if
shes
