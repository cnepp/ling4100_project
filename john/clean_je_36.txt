oh
hi
was
it
by
any
chance
a
meteor
oh
man
its
kind
of
a
long
story
anyway
are
you
ok
did
it
blow
up
your
yard
or
start
a
fire
or
anything
well
gosh
hes
probably
right
er
yeah
i
was
trying
to
get
it
but
rose
dropped
my
car
into
a
weird
spooky
bottomless
pit
and
the
package
was
in
the
car
and
im
really
sorry
about
that
wow
ok
i
guess
i
should
start
at
the
beginning
see
a
meteor
blew
up
my
neighborhood
but
im
ok
and
my
house
is
too
sort
of
that
game
i
was
telling
you
about
sburb
which
i
was
playing
with
rose
sort
of
transported
me
somewhere
at
the
last
minute
but
now
im
trapped
here
and
its
weird
and
dark
and
i
cant
find
my
dad
and
i
just
lost
the
car
and
my
copy
of
the
game
in
the
pit
and
i
think
i
have
to
save
the
world
from
the
apocalypse
wow
you
think
so
well
ok
but
its
not
even
that
simple
i
was
about
to
connect
to
rose
to
help
transport
her
and
save
her
from
meteors
and
fire
and
stuff
but
she
lost
battery
power
and
i
lost
the
game
disc
so
i
think
i
have
to
get
tg
to
use
his
copy
to
save
her
but
that
jackass
wont
shut
up
and
stop
rapping
and
stuff
yeah
anyway
i
should
talk
to
him
about
it
so
brb
