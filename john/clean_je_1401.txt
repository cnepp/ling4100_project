ill
think
about
it
well
yeah
it
sounds
like
an
important
item
so
deciding
what
to
do
with
it
is
kind
of
a
big
responsibility
its
supposed
to
bring
ghosts
back
to
life
but
we
dont
know
how
it
works
what
if
it
only
keeps
you
alive
as
long
as
youre
wearing
it
that
would
mean
only
one
ghost
could
come
back
but
there
are
a
lot
of
ghosts
im
just
not
sure
what
to
do
yet
yeah
well
frankly
i
dont
give
a
shit
about
the
orange
guy
the
ring
is
mine
for
now
so
im
the
one
who
has
to
figure
out
what
to
do
with
it
speaking
of
waking
up
its
probably
time
i
got
going
too
im
not
trying
to
join
the
mutiny
or
anything
but
i
do
have
friends
waiting
for
me
out
there
uh
its
fine
we
can
stay
friends
i
dont
really
like
to
make
enemies
with
people
even
if
theyre
umm
