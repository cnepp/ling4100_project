i
dunno
but
i
think
it
might
have
to
do
with
this
new
power
i
have
its
not
a
god
tier
power
its
something
else
something
i
got
when
i
stuck
my
hand
in
a
magic
thing
um
thats
a
long
story
one
involving
pirates
i
said
its
a
long
story
anyway
when
i
put
my
hand
in
the
thing
i
became
all
blurry
yes
and
i
kept
randomly
getting
blurry
and
disappearing
and
now
i
think
im
sort
of
unstuck
in
existence
like
im
not
fully
a
part
of
reality
anymore
or
bound
by
the
rules
governing
it
man
im
doing
a
terrible
job
explaining
this
ok
the
bottom
line
is
now
i
just
randomly
disappear
sometimes
and
i
reappear
somewhere
else
in
time
and
space
but
its
not
really
like
normal
time
travel
at
least
i
dont
think
so
with
regular
time
travel
the
rules
are
pretty
strict
either
paradox
space
already
accounted
for
your
time
traveling
and
you
were
always
supposed
to
do
it
all
along
or
you
messed
up
and
changed
something
you
werent
supposed
to
in
which
case
you
just
made
a
bad
timeline
and
everyone
dies
or
something
right
but
this
isnt
like
that
im
not
sure
how
i
know
but
it
feels
like
these
jumps
are
totally
outside
all
those
rules
when
i
jump
somewhere
like
in
the
past
i
think
i
can
actually
change
stuff
that
isnt
supposed
to
be
changed
which
makes
me
kinda
nervous
not
really
i
mean
not
intentionally
i
cant
seem
to
control
the
jumps
maybe
thats
for
the
best
though
if
i
could
control
it
and
tried
to
use
it
to
my
advantage
i
would
probably
just
make
a
huge
mess
of
things
yeah
ummmm
well
we
were
all
pretty
confused
at
first
you
all
just
appeared
out
of
nowhere
and
started
babbling
about
evil
jade
you
asked
me
what
happened
but
i
didnt
know
anything
because
i
just
got
there
myself
and
was
all
alone
but
then
it
was
cool
we
all
just
walked
around
the
land
of
hills
and
stone
henges
or
whatever
its
called
and
caught
up
a
bit
on
the
last
three
years
we
were
trying
to
figure
out
what
to
do
and
decided
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
try
and
meet
up
with
all
the
new
kids
but
we
had
no
idea
where
they
were
and
i
still
dont
except
i
have
since
determined
that
my
teen
nanna
is
evil
too
but
she
is
more
like
an
evil
robot
than
a
scary
wolf
girl
um
but
i
digress
so
we
were
planning
to
make
some
scouting
expeditions
to
the
new
planets
to
look
for
them
and
everything
was
fine
that
is
until
evil
jade
showed
up
she
made
you
all
disappear
again
and
then
came
after
me
but
i
used
my
windy
powers
to
evade
her
which
really
pissed
her
off
so
she
beat
the
crap
out
of
me
but
then
i
randomly
zapped
away
and
have
been
running
from
her
ever
since
i
am
swishing
the
breeze
around
like
crazy
to
throw
her
off
my
trail
but
she
keeps
finding
me
shes
so
crafty
yes
i
can
try
what
should
i
do
when
i
find
them
heheh
alright
if
i
see
your
mom
is
there
anything
you
want
me
to
tell
her
yes
i
mean
your
kid
mom
obviously
