hey
vriska
sorry
to
keep
you
waiting
yeah
i
know
um
sorry
to
cut
this
short
but
this
isnt
really
the
best
time
to
chat
i
am
in
the
middle
of
an
ocean
of
oil
that
is
ablaze
with
a
lot
of
green
fire
i
need
to
figure
out
a
way
to
escape
unfortunately
i
fell
asleep
for
some
reason
and
my
bed
landed
here
i
cant
believe
i
was
so
stupid
you
were
um
you
can
do
that
hmm
what
do
you
mean
limit
are
you
saying
you
can
usually
do
more
than
that
ok
that
is
pretty
cool
i
guess
but
why
why
would
you
put
me
to
sleep
and
put
me
in
this
predicament
ok
but
i
kind
of
get
that
but
its
also
kind
of
odd
if
youre
seeing
my
future
and
you
know
those
things
are
the
outcome
then
why
are
you
going
back
and
i
guess
involving
yourself
with
these
events
see
what
i
mean
ok
that
sort
of
makes
sense
i
guess
but
its
kind
of
hurting
my
head
to
think
about
ah
ha
so
you
did
watch
that
video
i
sent
what
did
you
think
