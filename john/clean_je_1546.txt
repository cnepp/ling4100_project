er
i
dont
know
whoops
sorry
im
sorry
jeez
it
was
an
accident
no
no
please
dont
i
didnt
mean
to
come
here
really
i
still
cant
control
the
jumps
im
trying
but
it
just
no
its
not
time
travel
well
not
technically
no
i
swear
ok
see
i
went
on
a
dream
quest
with
some
troll
pirates
argh
never
mind
thats
the
long
version
of
the
story
ok
so
i
stuck
my
hand
in
this
little
magic
house
and
what
i
know
im
sorry
i
would
zap
away
again
but
i
dont
know
how
its
not
time
travel
though
i
promise
i
dunno
like
some
kind
of
surreal
history
altering
reality
hopping
magic
power
no
way
dude
you
have
to
trust
me
on
this
this
isnt
a
doomed
timeline
im
telling
you
i
can
change
things
stuff
that
wasnt
supposed
to
be
changed
and
im
not
saying
bad
stuff
wont
happen
as
a
result
of
the
things
i
change
but
at
least
it
wont
make
a
doomed
timeline
the
new
things
that
happen
will
just
be
the
stuff
thats
supposed
to
happen
it
does
um
earth
to
dave
i
already
said
i
dont
have
a
clue
what
im
doing
what
was
i
interrupting
you
were
aw
man
im
sorry
i
am
fucking
this
up
so
bad
see
this
is
what
im
worried
about
even
though
my
random
jumps
are
supposed
to
be
a
safe
form
of
time
travel
im
still
nervous
that
i
might
be
ruining
important
events
anyway
like
there
was
all
this
crazy
stuff
that
happened
to
get
us
here
whether
it
was
good
or
bad
and
if
i
fumble
around
like
this
accidentally
changing
all
that
stuff
then
i
wont
even
know
whats
going
on
anymore
maybe
no
one
will
thats
what
im
saying
things
are
complicated
enough
as
it
is
ok
look
maybe
we
can
try
to
minimize
my
impact
on
the
current
situation
if
i
fly
away
do
you
think
you
can
do
whatever
you
were
going
to
do
in
the
first
place
do
you
know
what
you
were
going
to
do
ok
im
glad
the
mayor
is
alive
and
well
but
this
is
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
avoid
isnt
there
some
way
you
could
just
pretend
i
never
showed
up
and
let
this
play
out
the
way
it
was
supposed
to
damn
it
