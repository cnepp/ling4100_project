well
if
you
do
not
have
any
objection
maybe
later
i
will
drop
by
your
planet
again
and
rescue
you
thus
breaking
the
spooky
spell
put
on
you
by
your
nefarious
shadowy
masters
that
way
you
will
stop
being
so
grimdark
and
ominous
and
basically
completely
off
the
deep
end
in
every
way
as
is
now
painfully
obvious
to
anyone
with
a
brain
yes
please
write
some
happy
stories
in
your
journal
about
lively
horses
and
conspicuously
not
about
wizards
or
sadness
yes
this
is
good
you
see
rose
these
are
jokes
this
are
what
they
look
like
do
not
be
alarmed
laughs
rose
laaaughs
also
those
crescenty
looking
holes
where
laughs
come
out
of
those
are
smiles
observe
d
ok
i
will
wait
patiently
no
rose
that
sort
of
nonsense
is
exactly
what
is
out
of
the
question
i
see
things
are
more
urgent
than
i
realized
i
will
have
to
venture
there
straightaway
and
slap
you
right
out
of
that
silly
old
trance
oh
well
shit
oh
yeah

is
this
treasure
anyway
and
hows
it
gonna
save
us

me
anyway

shittiest
sounding
treasure
i
have
ever
heard
