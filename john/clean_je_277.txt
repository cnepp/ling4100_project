um
i
dont
know
you
can
see
my
future
cant
you
how
much
time
am
i
wasting
then
i
would
venture
to
guess
i
am
wasting
time
because
you
chose
to
pester
me
just
now
i
mean
i
was
just
pausing
for
a
moment
to
look
at
my
trashed
movie
posters
they
bring
back
memories
of
a
life
that
i
guess
is
long
gone
now
but
you
probably
know
what
that
is
all
about
it
wasnt
even
that
long
ago
but
it
already
seems
like
forever
since
i
was
on
earth
it
was
a
pretty
nice
place
i
bet
you
would
have
liked
it
well
what
about
you
do
you
miss
your
planet
and
your
parents
and
such
oh
thats
too
bad
but
you
see
that
is
where
you
are
wrong
these
films
are
the
finest
earth
has
to
offer
no
no
i
drew
those
clowns
in
my
sleep
for
some
reason
this
one
here
is
so
great
it
is
about
this
street
tough
renegade
who
did
hard
time
behind
bars
and
wants
nothing
more
in
the
world
than
to
reunite
with
his
loving
wife
and
daughter
but
not
so
fast
he
has
to
go
on
crazy
and
dangerous
escapades
through
the
sky
with
a
motley
assortment
of
rogues
led
by
malkovich
who
is
wise
to
cages
heroic
nature
and
pure
heart
they
tether
a
grumpy
police
mans
awesome
car
to
the
plane
and
smash
it
and
then
later
they
crash
into
some
casinos
cage
gets
out
of
the
wreckage
and
hugs
his
family
and
i
usually
tear
up
a
little
that
is
my
working
troll
title
for
the
movie
i
hope
it
was
ok
yeah
well
you
are
hilariously
wrong
here
hang
on
i
will
show
you
httptinyurlcomhullohumminburr
oh
but
you
will
probably
have
to
use
your
troll
thingy
to
rewind
time
or
whatever
to
before
the
earth
internet
blew
up
so
you
can
watch
it
i
guess
ok
suit
yourself
but
there
it
is
in
case
you
are
ever
hankering
after
some
incredible
movie
magic
ok
good
idea
