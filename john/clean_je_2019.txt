roxy
shes
nice
really
nice
she
is
fun
and
easy
to
talk
to
it
almost
feels
like
she
has
always
been
one
of
our
friends
you
know
umm
not
too
long
we
only
met
like
a
day
ago
i
mean
from
my
perspective
shes
been
through
some
really
difficult
stuff
recently
well
we
both
have
actually
but
i
feel
like
it
was
all
a
bit
more
personal
for
her
being
on
her
adventure
then
suddenly
losing
all
her
friends
and
watching
rose
die
right
there
while
shed
been
kinda
viewing
rose
as
a
version
of
her
mom
i
was
just
some
goofball
drifting
randomly
here
and
there
between
realities
so
i
was
mostly
just
confused
by
everything
but
for
her
i
could
tell
it
was
all
really
devastating
im
so
happy
she
gets
to
be
with
rose
again
not
to
mention
all
her
other
friends
for
some
reason
i
feel
happier
for
her
getting
to
reunite
with
people
she
lost
than
i
do
for
myself
i
do
oh
uh
hm
i
dont
know
maybe
i
didnt
say
i
did
though
oh
ok
man
im
not
sure
if
we
should
keep
thinking
about
all
our
relations
that
way
its
kinda
weird
im
not
dating
her
though
jeez
i
dont
know
i
i
dont
know
if
im
ready
for
every
single
deep
conversation
we
can
squeeze
into
this
wacky
rapid
fire
session
of
fun
paltalk
you
do
why
ok
thats
actually
kind
of
cute
alright
well
no
matter
what
happens
its
ok
with
me
if
you
want
to
think
of
her
that
way
