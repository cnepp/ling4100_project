i
found
it
very
deep
in
the
palace
dungeon
i
was
wandering
for
hours
following
a
horrible
sound
through
the
pipes
i
could
tell
typheus
was
really
close
because
it
was
very
loud
here
it
could
only
be
the
sound
of
him
sleeping
i
was
so
tempted
to
play
it
but
i
didnt
dare
risk
waking
him
up
pretty
much
by
then
i
was
sweating
bullets
at
the
thought
of
confronting
him
yeah
i
guess
if
i
ever
see
her
i
should
thank
her
too
because
this
was
important
well
yes
but
not
just
that
the
whole
ruse
was
important
if
i
didnt
make
the
decision
to
go
then
dave
would
not
be
able
to
go
back
in
time
and
fix
things
in
fact
if
i
didnt
die
here
in
this
palace
we
never
would
have
been
born
in
the
first
place
this
way
