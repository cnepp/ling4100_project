fine
then
i
guess
its
settled
i
will
go
to
lowas
and
see
my
denizen
but
what
will
you
guys
do
nothing
oh
i
mean
even
though
everything
in
this
timeline
is
about
as
shitty
as
it
gets
that
still
seems
kinda
sad
i
guess
so
what
do
you
think
you
will
do
with
the
time
you
have
left
holy
shit
thats
the
saddest
thing
ive
ever
heard
argh
whyd
you
even
have
to
tell
me
that
no
that
sucks
dont
do
that
because
its
stupid
plan
for
crappy
idiots
yes
laugh
at
my
truly
sick
burn
if
you
must
but
everyones
getting
on
my
case
for
being
so
defeatist
and
thats
the
best
plan
you
can
come
up
with
yeah
i
just
think
no
matter
whos
going
to
stop
existing
when
if
i
do
something
proactive
then
you
should
too
even
if
only
on
principle
why
dont
you
go
see
your
denizen
too
thats
your
denizen
there
isnt
it
yes
i
know
its
a
statue
i
mean
it
is
a
depiction
of
her
right
so
if
im
going
to
see
mine
why
dont
you
go
see
yours
too
why
not
no
but
you
still
have
things
to
learn
dont
you
did
you
ever
make
that
spike
ball
i
dunno
its
just
a
thing
you
were
going
to
set
your
mind
to
but
havent
done
yet
just
like
i
said
i
was
going
to
get
that
magic
ring
so
you
can
give
it
to
your
friend
remember
that
i
havent
done
that
yet
either
but
that
doesnt
mean
i
have
to
give
up
on
that
idea
what
if
after
i
see
my
denizen
what
if
i
could
still
do
that
im
just
saying
you
have
no
idea
what
there
is
to
learn
from
her
maybe
finding
out
what
there
is
to
learn
is
most
of
what
there
is
to
learn
what
if
making
alien
spike
balls
is
only
the
beginning
of
understanding
your
powers
what
if
she
can
help
you
channel
some
sort
of
incredible
voidey
thing
yes
like
a
windy
thing
but
with
void
instead
of
wind
a
windy
thing
is
obviously
a
bunch
of
damn
wind
blowing
around
no
i
didnt
mean
it
that
literally
i
mean
maybe
something
more
abstract
like
i
dunno
learn
to
phase
out
of
reality
and
somehow
preserve
yourself
in
the
void
even
if
i
alter
history
so
that
maybe
when
the
time
is
right
you
can
just
pop
back
into
reality
i
have
no
idea
im
just
saying
who
knows
ok
yes
probably
it
just
feels
shitty
leaving
you
here
to
have
a
sad
funeral
and
then
stop
existing
le
shrug
my
la
butt
im
not
going
to
see
my
denizen
unless
you
agree
to
see
yours
that
is
the
deal
and
thats
final
