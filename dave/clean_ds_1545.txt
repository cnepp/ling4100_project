im
serious
the
thing
is
being
a
time
guy
like
actually
mastering
time
travel
im
pretty
sure
what
that
involves
is
learning
to
never
use
it
see
its
like
karate
well
its
more
like
what
they
say
about
karate
that
you
learn
it
so
you
dont
use
it
but
i
mean
we
all
know
the
truth
about
karate
is
if
you
know
karate
then
obviously
in
reality
you
use
it
all
the
time
like
doing
lethal
fuckin
crane
kicks
and
sweet
karate
chops
while
walking
down
the
street
just
cause
you
can
its
a
god
damn
no
brainer
thats
what
you
do
with
karate
john
what
the
fuck
are
you
doing
here
