um
oh
well
let
me
tell
you
vriska
was
most
certainly
alive
during
this
one
like
almost
extraalive
if
thats
possible
ok
dude
maybe
lets
not
spend
our
paltime
trash
talking
serket
if
only
cus
theres
no
way
youre
not
getting
repeatedly
trounced
exactly
just
like
that
dude
karkat
what
the
fuck
are
you
doing
ok
its
not
an
unreasonable
conversation
to
have
but
like
we
just
started
friendjamming
about
past
anecdotes
to
get
us
all
up
to
speed
or
whatever
and
youre
already
trucking
out
these
guns
just
sayin
it
doesnt
sound
that
casual
and
no
big
deal
if
you
keep
saying
its
casual
and
no
big
deal
oh
and
also
its
the
first
fuckin
thing
out
of
your
mouth
to
john
in
three
years
yo
im
hardly
one
to
talk
here
since
i
am
a
goddamn
geyser
of
hilariously
selfpulverizing
freudian
bloopers
at
this
point
i
cant
even
pretend
to
keep
a
lid
on
any
shit
ive
got
in
me
cause
i
know
sooner
or
later
during
one
of
my
rad
soliloquies
ill
just
pratfall
butt
backwards
into
an
embarrassing
admission
and
i
just
have
to
be
like
yeah
yeah
ok
thats
my
shit
thats
what
im
about
lets
just
get
the
fuck
on
with
our
lives
so
when
johns
like
hey
man
and
youre
all
locked
and
loaded
with
some
stuff
about
how
youre
over
him
and
go
on
and
on
about
it
its
like
some
way
obvious
protesttoomuch
shit
and
everybody
knows
it
so
i
dont
see
how
it
salvages
any
of
your
dignity
or
whatever
to
pretend
thats
not
whats
happening
so
what
im
saying
is
if
youre
so
eager
to
push
this
out
there
if
youre
pushing
this
out
there
which
you
are
then
maybe
we
should
rap
about
it
i
mean
discuss
it
critically
and
earnestly
not
drop
ill
rhymes
or
anything
tho
that
could
be
sweet
too
so
are
you
sure
you
still
dont
have
these
unreconciled
blackrom
feelings
about
john
i
say
we
air
this
out
before
it
ferments
into
some
rank
and
hella
unexamined
feeling
sauce
no
i
dont
do
that
to
bros
thats
huge
uncool
i
dont
see
what
has
to
be
uncomfy
about
chattin
out
our
true
ass
thoughts
and
emotions
dude
you
clearly
had
a
spades
thing
for
john
but
i
dont
recall
you
ever
bringing
it
up
is
this
something
you
been
thinking
about
all
this
time
or
yeah
we
coulda
talked
about
this
i
have
all
kinds
of
shit
to
say
about
john
seeing
as
he
was
my
number
dude
for
approximately
the
majority
of
years
the
main
dead
end
here
man
is
like
nothing
personal
at
all
its
just
that
he
is
literally
incapable
of
hating
anyone
gettin
pissed
off
at
a
suspender
dude
sounds
like
just
the
sort
of
yarn
i
wanna
be
all
ears
for
some
time
but
ok
thats
something
to
work
with
hey
karkat
maybe
theres
some
hope
yet
maybe
its
not
a
total
lost
cause
own
what
no
way
im
being
real
as
a
motherfucker
what
part
john
dude
i
gotta
say
when
you
talk
about
being
or
not
being
a
homosexual
you
kinda
sound
like
a
corny
old
man
what
does
normal
mean
though
normal
was
some
crap
that
ruled
our
dead
civilization
we
left
that
behind
years
ago
its
all
a
huge
pile
of
shit
that
doesnt
matter
anymore
im
not
sure
i
guess
ok
i
guess
what
im
saying
is
i
dont
think
its
all
as
simple
as
you
think
it
is
or
maybe
not
like
actively
think
it
is
but
continue
to
assume
it
is
on
account
of
not
thinkin
about
it
much
due
to
a
lot
of
junk
about
the
subject
that
gets
shoved
into
our
brains
from
movies
and
stuff
while
we
were
just
dumb
kids
im
just
saying
it
probably
isnt
as
absolute
or
simplistic
as
the
way
youve
been
framing
it
or
maybe
it
is
for
you
personally
i
dont
know
im
just
guessing
you
havent
spent
much
time
thinking
about
it
if
only
cause
all
the
stuff
we
read
and
watch
suggests
that
like
even
examining
your
honest
thoughts
about
it
is
perilous
road
to
go
down
cause
if
you
actually
think
too
much
about
it
without
always
having
that
undercurrent
of
haha
nope
nope
nope
then
what
happens
what
if
it
turns
out
youre
like
like
not
exactly
the
way
you
thought
you
were
or
maybe
not
so
much
that
as
old
presumptions
about
what
you
were
turn
out
to
be
not
that
relevant
i
dunno
man
not
sure
what
youve
been
doing
the
last
years
all
riding
a
large
boat
then
saving
everyone
from
apocalyptic
whatever
but
ive
had
a
fuck
ton
of
time
on
my
hands
to
think
about
stuff
about
stuff
ive
said
and
done
in
the
past
why
i
said
and
did
them
a
lot
of
things
i
once
would
have
insisted
were
like
part
of
my
brand
and
helped
me
come
across
cool
and
smartassy
but
now
im
not
so
sure
we
used
rip
on
each
other
all
the
time
for
being
gay
even
though
we
knew
we
werent
which
of
course
is
what
made
it
funny
remember
yeah
i
know
it
frankly
is
funny
to
say
how
gay
something
is
sometimes
and
lets
face
it
sometimes
someone
or
something
is
just
flat
out
really
fucking
gay
and
theres
no
two
ways
about
it
its
more
like
that
through
the
preponderance
of
all
that
jokey
shit
is
an
underlying
implication
that
its
all
lame
stuff
for
pansies
but
not
like
us
no
were
not
lame
and
ha
ha
thats
the
joke
which
thrives
on
this
like
doubleburied
implication
that
the
real
cool
shit
is
founded
on
this
absurd
wanky
ideal
about
masculinity
which
if
you
think
about
it
is
dumb
as
fuck
the
male
adulation
of
masculinity
to
that
extent
to
be
honest
is
pretty
fucking
gay
unto
itself
and
was
always
some
totally
impossible
shit
for
us
to
live
up
to
anyway
i
think
all
thats
mixed
up
with
the
same
phony
ideals
about
heroism
like
living
up
to
the
storybook
idea
of
what
a
hero
to
me
feels
almost
interchangeable
with
living
up
to
societys
snapshot
of
what
a
hard
manly
dude
should
be
i
stopped
pretending
i
could
ever
live
up
to
either
thing
a
while
ago
and
mainly
have
spent
time
looking
back
on
the
sheer
magnitude
of
all
my
joking
around
i
used
to
lambaste
fuckers
left
and
right
grinding
them
into
the
pavement
over
how
gay
they
probably
were
and
how
much
they
were
quite
possibly
jonesin
to
kiss
some
dudes
or
such
and
i
dont
really
feel
bad
about
it
in
the
sense
that
it
was
jerky
or
like
insensitive
necessarily
even
though
i
guess
it
maybe
was
more
that
i
feel
like
it
was
probably
transparent
a
massive
front
of
outrageous
snark
to
disguise
a
lot
of
insecurity
like
a
fuckin
coverup
as
long
as
i
kept
clowning
hard
about
it
i
didnt
actually
have
to
think
about
it
or
face
my
actual
beliefs
what
no
man
no
look
dude
you
arent
listening
although
a
gay
butterfly
effect
is
a
pretty
funny
idea
lets
not
dismiss
that
as
a
concept
altogether
anyway
maybe
what
im
tryin
to
say
is
sorta
getting
lost
in
the
weeds
here
the
fact
that
you
were
wondering
if
i
turned
gay
makes
me
think
maybe
youre
still
not
quite
on
the
wavelength
im
tryin
to
ramble
on
here
maybe
we
should
wrestle
this
topic
to
the
ground
another
time
theres
a
lot
more
id
wanna
say
but
this
is
probably
not
the
venue
i
mean
not
literally
wrestle
to
the
ground
because
that
is
maybe
literally
the
gayest
course
of
action
we
could
possibly
take
but
you
know
what
i
mean
uh
