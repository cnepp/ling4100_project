ok
then
do
it
but
this
was
my
mission
that
doesnt
make
sense
why
would
they
drag
me
into
it
just
to
have
me
make
a
map
and
then
let
you
ditch
me
theyve
obviously
been
gunning
for
me
too
why
do
you
think
that
but
i
dont
want
you
to
die
this
isnt
right
so
you
admit
you
were
stalling
with
all
that
bullshit
what
do
you
mean
what
sure
but
if
im
promising
not
to
chase
you
down
then
theres
not
really
any
hurry
to
wake
up
nah
ill
stay
asleep
a
while
what
did
you
want
me
to
tell
john
what
no
what
