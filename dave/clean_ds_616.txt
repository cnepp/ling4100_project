i
busted
into
his
palace
to
finish
the
quest
i
was
expecting
him
to
be
asleep
and
was
gonna
figure
out
some
way
to
wake
him
up
but
like
last
time
i
saw
him
he
was
already
awake
to
greet
me
they
are
as
sprites
were
programmed
to
know
things
like
that
about
the
game
but
i
guess
not
everything
it
seems
like
if
you
try
to
go
fight
them
too
soon
you
find
them
awake
and
theyre
like
what
the
fuck
are
you
doing
here
already
which
is
what
happened
last
time
i
saw
him
before
i
became
a
sprite
and
i
stupidly
tried
to
fight
him
which
was
a
bad
idea
because
hes
hella
strong
and
the
whole
time
he
was
raving
about
shit
about
a
stolen
sword
and
missing
forge
but
i
wasnt
really
listening
if
i
had
i
might
have
understood
he
wasnt
actually
trying
to
kill
me
he
was
giving
me
the
choice
wait
i
mean
the
choice
i
always
forget
i
can
talk
underlined
for
important
shit
i
guess
i
made
an
unwitting
choice
by
deciding
to
flee
i
figured
he
was
unbeatable
so
i
decided
to
get
the
fuck
out
of
there
so
i
snapped
a
quick
captcha
to
get
his
huge
hammers
code
and
then
gtfo
like
i
said
he
was
awake
again
but
this
time
i
wasnt
in
any
condition
to
fight
so
i
didnt
and
thats
what
i
didnt
get
hes
this
terrible
angry
monstrous
guy
but
theres
no
need
to
fight
him
so
he
looked
me
up
and
down
all
hard
saw
the
broken
sword
and
like
before
gave
me
the
choice
yeah
no
