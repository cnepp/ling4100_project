no
fuck
that
im
a
lie
my
ass
right
down
here
for
a
while
looking
slightly
less
cool
than
i
make
myself
out
to
be
ordinarily
that
is
basically
what
i
just
did
isnt
it
thats
what
im
doing
here
im
making
a
point
of
makin
every
little
thing
take
place
what
was
once
mentioned
in
passing
no
matter
how
seemingly
trivial
or
pointless
thats
how
all
the
best
adventures
get
strung
together
you
havent
heard
me
bleat
like
a
goat
for
ironically
humorous
purposes
yet
have
you
that
was
something
that
was
mentioned
at
some
point
by
someone
i
forget
when
or
why
i
bet
you
are
on
goddamn
pins
and
needles
waiting
for
that
arent
you
no
fuck
that
no
fuck
you
go
away
what
i
dunno
why
are
you
even
talking
to
me
anyway
aside
from
the
fact
that
several
hours
from
now
you
apparently
forget
i
dont
need
consolation
and
oughta
be
left
alone
oh
bitten
what
that
sure
sounds
like
a
dumb
way
to
say
a
thing
almost
egbertian
in
elegant
stupidity
the
t
in
egbertian
is
soft
like
shhhhh
why
would
i
get
mad
at
you
ok
but
yeah
i
guess
its
about
time
you
showed
me
whats
up
with
my
allegedly
futile
god
tierification
how
long
ago
was
it
that
you
did
your
coin
flip
thing
i
dont
even
remember
i
was
getting
sure
you
were
just
bullshitting
me
and
had
no
intention
of
ever
mentioning
it
again
for
what
before
what
happens
you
mean
god
tiering
does
something
go
wrong
thats
practically
unthinkable
but
i
mean
ok
we
can
talk
about
your
troll
problem
but
this
is
pretty
important
here
the
god
tier
thing
and
whether
i
can
actually
do
it
or
not
it
might
be
kind
of
hard
to
tell
on
account
of
me
chilling
face
down
on
the
pavement
and
also
because
downplaying
feelings
is
the
chief
rule
of
cool
but
im
pretty
pissed
about
this
which
is
weird
no
its
not
weird
to
be
mad
its
just
weird
it
feels
like
im
the
only
one
who
is
and
the
only
one
even
contemplating
taking
jack
on
even
among
your
group
of
irate
gnashing
shitheads
what
well
ok
and
that
would
be
a
bitchin
line
to
switch
the
subject
to
start
talkin
about
your
complicated
problems
but
i
kinda
wasnt
done
but
ok
i
mean
isnt
that
what
heroes
should
be
doing
working
to
take
down
the
bad
guy
without
a
whole
lot
of
this
fuckin
grandiloquence
and
these
huge
sweeping
plans
that
got
nothin
to
do
with
fighting
him
like
always
biding
our
time
and
tiptoeing
around
the
unbeatable
god
boss
johns
too
nice
to
get
mad
rose
spends
all
her
time
calculating
too
focused
on
machiavellian
ploys
of
sabotage
to
try
anything
drastic
jade
is
i
dont
even
know
probably
more
a
liability
if
she
got
it
in
her
head
to
take
him
down
if
anything
id
bet
she
just
needs
protection
im
just
wondering
when
does
someone
actually
step
up
jacks
got
shit
to
pay
for
yeah
i
guess
i
guess
it
has
been
on
my
mind
maybe
i
am
supposed
to
be
a
hero
and
rise
to
the
occasion
because
there
seems
to
be
this
little
persistent
voice
in
my
head
nagging
me
about
it
insisting
someones
gotta
pay
and
its
hard
for
me
to
disagree
what
things
