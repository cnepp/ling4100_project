i
was
in
this
dark
place
surrounded
by
this
big
flock
of
crows
god
this
is
so
generically
morbid
im
sorry
in
advance
for
exposing
you
to
my
unconscious
minds
retarded
cliches
well
obviously
i
knew
the
birds
were
just
black
screaming
sky
dongs
just
hear
me
out
i
kept
dying
there
kept
being
these
traps
like
i
would
go
one
way
and
get
my
head
chopped
off
or
go
another
way
and
get
stabbed
or
whatever
and
every
time
i
died
the
dream
reset
itself
and
i
was
standing
there
alive
and
ready
to
try
to
escape
again
but
each
time
i
would
be
watching
myself
from
the
vantage
point
of
a
different
crow
like
i
was
the
crow
all
squawking
around
in
circles
like
a
macabre
flapping
douche
and
i
would
always
watch
myself
try
to
do
something
different
to
dodge
the
trap
but
i
always
ended
up
dead
you
mean
maybe
its
about
anxiety
over
maintaining
my
blogs
or
that
my
beats
might
not
be
ill
enough
and
then
we
crack
up
laughing
cause
we
both
know
theyre
fresher
than
your
moms
change
of
drawers
and
tighter
than
when
shes
wearin
them
please
its
not
like
shes
my
mom
i
can
visualize
her
choice
ass
all
i
want
without
it
gettin
much
more
than
moderately
uncomfortable
for
everyone
involved
about
what
uh
this
isnt
the
first
time
youve
insinuated
were
related
what
is
up
with
that
no
i
mean
im
not
sure
i
feel
like
youve
brought
it
up
before
which
is
kind
of
weird
but
now
i
dont
know
i
think
im
getting
this
weird
deja
vu
thing
where
i
was
sure
we
talked
about
this
forget
it
ok
so
i
kept
dying
and
kept
being
crows
and
stuff
and
then
i
started
to
notice
something
coming
from
the
sky
it
was
this
faint
eerie
singing
and
i
look
up
and
theres
nothing
there
just
darkness
what
did
you
read
what
the
fuck
sort
of
crackpot
psychology
text
would
say
something
like
that
so
then
youre
consulting
astrology
books
now
oh
my
fucking
god
will
you
put
that
away
theres
not
even
much
more
to
it
i
looked
up
into
the
sky
didnt
see
anyone
singing
but
even
though
the
sky
was
black
i
could
see
the
sun
it
was
bright
as
hell
even
through
my
shades
so
i
flapped
my
wings
and
flew
up
away
to
it
like
a
fucking
piece
of
garbage
and
thats
it
no
not
in
the
sense
that
it
was
a
dark
sacrificial
zoology
mission
it
was
more
like
somewhere
to
go
besides
watching
myself
die
a
lot
from
the
vantage
of
a
feathery
murder
of
dumb
shitty
birds
what
the
fuck
are
you
talking
about
ok
somethings
wrong
this
whole
conversation
is
falling
apart
this
isnt
how
it
originally
went
at
all
this
happened
months
ago
does
this
mean
im
dead
