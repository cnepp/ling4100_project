thats
exactly
my
name
everyone
stupidly
insists
on
calling
me
though
my
bro
hes
dead
unless
you
mean
the
kid
version
as
in
the
guy
we
both
saw
with
the
pointy
shades
remember
he
grabbed
my
sleeping
teen
mom
and
flew
away
and
that
was
the
last
i
saw
of
him
what
when
did
you
give
him
a
high
five
why
wasnt
i
informed
of
this
high
five
that
took
place
oh
karkat
you
mean
i
dunno
hes
around
i
saw
him
talking
to
his
ancestor
a
while
ago
dont
think
he
likes
him
very
much
i
doubt
he
actually
wants
to
but
you
know
how
it
is
with
ancestors
ok
maybe
you
dont
since
i
guess
youre
actually
an
ancestor
yourself
or
you
were
to
some
dead
girl
i
never
met
but
anyway
they
just
seem
to
i
dont
know
have
this
inexplicable
power
over
you
i
mean
look
at
kanaya
over
there
shes
a
fucking
shambles
about
hers
like
it
isnt
even
rational
or
anything
they
just
represent
something
you
measure
yourself
up
to
and
even
though
they
probably
arent
all
theyre
cracked
up
to
be
it
just
kind
of
gets
in
your
head
you
know
and
on
that
day
human
whats
his
cape
learned
the
only
real
treasure
was
a
forced
sense
of
self
esteem
he
thanked
the
punky
sea
princess
for
her
radical
wisdom
and
then
she
went
away
yeah
i
saw
it
i
was
looking
up
in
space
doing
a
little
monster
gazing
right
when
suddenly
i
thought
my
glasses
shattered
but
it
wasnt
the
shades
turned
out
it
was
space
itself
that
cracked
and
i
listened
and
i
heard
the
screams
and
killing
and
stuff
havent
slept
well
since
that
well
i
guess
im
sleeping
alright
at
the
moment
cause
im
here
in
a
bubble
talking
to
you
but
yeah
in
general
my
shuteye
has
been
boned
up
the
protein
chute
keeping
myself
busy
with
awesome
projects
helps
a
bit
i
guess
nope
appreciate
the
offer
but
im
just
gonna
hang
tight
and
work
on
my
ebubbles
ebubbles
theyre
awesome
its
just
some
ridiculous
shit
i
figured
out
how
to
do
here
this
whole
place
runs
on
memories
so
ive
been
messing
around
with
that
turns
out
i
dont
even
really
need
the
internet
for
shenanigans
i
can
just
exploit
the
afterlife
nah
i
mean
i
think
i
might
be
supposed
to
kill
him
anyway
thats
the
feeling
i
get
like
there
are
all
these
clues
about
that
ive
kinda
noticed
so
if
i
am
the
guy
that
needs
to
take
him
down
then
fine
ill
do
that
if
and
when
i
get
hornswoggled
into
some
big
showdown
with
a
ridiculous
green
space
pimp
or
whatever
he
is
i
dont
know
i
think
im
not
really
cut
out
for
the
whole
reluctant
hero
shtick
like
the
whole
scene
is
so
obvious
and
trite
and
i
cant
even
tell
if
my
reluctance
is
ironic
or
if
im
playing
it
straight
like
ill
wonder
if
im
being
reluctant
enough
to
cut
it
or
if
im
actually
just
being
reluctant
to
be
reluctant
it
turns
into
like
meta
reluctance
and
then
all
i
can
think
about
is
how
fucking
stupid
the
whole
thing
is
i
think
im
probably
just
too
self
aware
for
this
hero
bullshit
so
dont
even
waste
your
time
on
me
wait
you
want
to
be
me
ok
well
without
getting
too
deep
into
the
issue
of
how
absurd
that
request
is
on
the
very
face
of
it
its
just
not
going
to
happen
i
mean
not
yet
anyway
not
this
early
in
your
little
dream
bubble
quest
you
got
going
on
here
no
i
really
dont
think
we
should
get
too
meta
about
this
just
look
youre
on
a
mission
to
gather
up
all
your
dead
friends
and
build
an
army
or
something
personally
i
think
thats
a
shitty
idea
but
you
are
clearly
motivated
to
do
that
so
why
would
you
waste
time
going
around
being
other
people
it
doesnt
make
any
fucking
sense
for
instance
you
cant
be
anybody
in
this
fucking
sandy
beach
area
because
ostenibly
youre
just
charging
through
this
place
looking
for
your
friends
dammit
try
to
play
the
part
at
least
somewhat
maybe
when
you
catch
up
with
your
posse
you
can
be
some
of
those
guys
hell
maybe
you
can
be
some
of
us
too
after
the
whole
thing
youre
trying
to
do
winds
up
being
this
huge
predictable
disappointment
but
that
would
have
to
be
in
a
different
area
like
a
different
goddamn
bubble
zone
like
someones
memory
of
a
magic
fucking
forest
or
home
village
or
some
shit
i
dont
know
just
somewhere
the
fuck
else
now
go
away
