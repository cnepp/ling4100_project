up
soon
and

to

my
sleeping
corpse

reckless
indiana

where
you
come
in
i
got
your
back
dude

ill
make
myself
comfortable
here
when
you

up
ill
probably
get
going
what
do
you
mean
ill
just
sort
of
release
myself
go
do
my
own
thing
after
this
i
dont
think
youll
need
me
seems
like
youve
got
the
stable
time
loop
thing
figured
out
already
which
means
youll
be
alright
future
yous
will
get
you
out
of
trouble
if
youre
gonna
live
up
to
the
responsibility
of
eventually
becoming
them
and
by
virtue
of
loop
stability
it
sort
of
means
you
cant
technically
fuck
up
anymore
but
dont
let
that
idea
go
to
your
head
itll
mess
you
up
where
will
you
go
dunno
fly
around
up
away
to
the
sun
like
a
fucknig
piece
of
gargbage

if
i
can
catch
up
with
bro
maybe
elusive
bastard

do
you
think
he
is
what
happened
to
him
in
your
timeline

completely
lost
track
of
him
in
that
timeline

that
yeah

that
