wow
ok
youre
a
little
early
but
thats
fine
i
guess
also
you
suck
at
rockets
what
who
dude
you
did
go
through
the
second
gate
i
mean
i
dont
know
why
you
would
listen
to
her
again
kind
of
moronic
but
thats
a
whole
other
issue
she
didnt
trick
you
this
time
what
were
you
expecting
this
is
how
it
works
the
progression
of
gates
is
like
this
whole
round
robin
thing
cycling
through
each
planet
gate
on
your
planet
leads
to
gate
on
roses
then
you
build
up
to
gate
above
her
house
which
leads
somewhere
else
on
her
planet
you
look
for
gate
somewhere
there
which
leads
to
gate
above
my
house
and
so
on
ordinarily
rose
would
have
already
gone
through
her
gate
but
shes
sleeping
pretty
hard
obviously
and
ordinarily
you
wouldnt
have
gone
through
gate
until
her
house
was
built
up
so
you
wouldnt
fall
to
your
death
but
you
got
your
cheat
rocket
so
thats
fine
see
we
all
got
to
coordinate
on
this
thing
fuck
come
on
dude
god
dammit
i
am
the
real
you
know
the
one
who
saved
your
life
im
more
real
actually
cause
ive
been
through
some
heavy
shit
already
hopping
around
on
red
hot
gears
and
ibeams
for
like
a
year
and
grinding
shit
out
for
your
ungrateful
ass
here
look
check
out
this
code
from
the
future
not
that
you
deserve
it
wiin
youre
fucking
welcome
yo
what
did
you
do
ahahahahaha
pff
dont
worry
about
it
cause
i
wouldnt
give
a
shit
and
hes
me
what
really
ok
dont
go
anywhere

coming
down
to
the
computer

wants
to
use
the
computer
probably
to
help
you
scope
out
roses
room
and
snoop
and
stuff
i
mean
thats
what
i
would
have
done
if
you
were
alive
so

gonna
go
use
these
flappy
ghost
wings
and
tear
shit
up
in
space
