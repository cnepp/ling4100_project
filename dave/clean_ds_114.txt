you
mean
the
jumper
block
thing
wait
what
the
thing
costs
for
me
what
man
i
only
got
to
splash
around
with
in
roses
rainbow
world
what
the
hell
hang
on
ill
ask
she
says
yeah
so
i
guess
you
can
buy
everything
now
ok
now
i
know
youre
making
this
shit
up
well
all
i
got
here
is
the
designix
which
i
cant
deploy
cause
i
dont
have
any
purples
and
the
expensive
as
hell
jumper
thing
and
the
cheap
shunts
which
i
assume
do
dick
all
without
the
jumpers
to
put
em
on
oh
also
this
cd
which
is
but
i
didnt
drop
cause
it
seemed
like
a
stiff
allocation
of
resources
for
now
so
with
each
new
connection
in
our
player
chain
i
guess
new
weird
deployables
are
introduced
hey
look
were
learning
stuff
