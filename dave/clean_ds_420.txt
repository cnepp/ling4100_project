ok
what
do
you
mean
what
but
you
know
if
im
going
to
or
not
its
lame
for
you
to
pretend
theres
any
element
of
suspense
here
why
dont
you
just
tell
me
look
i
dont
mind
making
the
decision
if
thats
whats
going
on
here
like
doing
the
free
will
thing
yes
how
would
it
ever
stop
being
a
thing
being
a
things
not
something
it
ever
stopped
doing
i
just
want
to
know
whats
really
going
on
here
before
i
decide
to
start
choppin
off
the
heads
of
outrageously
good
looking
snoozing
dudes
ok
i
know
but
something
about
this
doesnt
add
up
who
is
this
guy
i
dont
remember
sleeping
on
this
bed
or
reaching
the
god
tier
im
pretty
sure
thats
something
id
remember
so
is
he
from
the
future
does
this
mean
later
im
going
to
have
to
put
this
ugly
goddamn
suit
back
on
which
i
thought
we
both
agreed
id
retired
from
the
wardrobe
forever
and
then
go
back
in
time
and
sleep
in
this
bed
and
get
killed
by
me
right
now
do
i
have
the
stable
loop
right
then
what
why
wouldnt
i
be
concerned
about
that
if
we
make
mistakes
then
dead
daves
start
piling
up
and
dead
daves
are
the
enemy
remember
says
the
sword
holding
guy
whos
about
to
add
one
to
the
pile
who
ok
got
it
i
wonder
if
this
can
finally
be
the
conversation
that
doesnt
deteriorate
into
a
lot
of
bitching
and
moaning
about
her
so
if
im
understanding
this
this
guy
isnt
from
the
future
who
came
back
to
finish
a
loop
and
hes
not
from
the
past
because
id
remember
doing
this
so
this
isnt
part
of
our
timeline
choreography
at
all
must
be
from
an
offshoot
timeline
which
means
hes
doomed
ok
so
how
did
this
happen
where
did
we
fuck
up
what
exactly
did
you
do
