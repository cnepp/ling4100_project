whoa
why
are
you
burning
your
wizard
fanfiction
oh
ok
then
why
are
you
burning
that
is
that
some
dumb
wizard
thing
you
just
made
up
or
something
to
do
with
tentacle
monsters
i
cant
keep
track
of
what
you
like
anymore
john
told
me
he
was
all
snoopin
around
your
room
while
you
were
asleep
and
i
was
like
no
man
dont
so
not
cool
then
he
was
like
haha
dude
check
it
out
this
book
is
full
of
wizard
slash
and
i
was
like
i
dont
even
want
to
know
this
is
such
a
crazy
violation
of
privacy
do
you
want
me
to
chew
him
out
about
it
i
will
because
that
was
so
outrageous
i
dont
know
where
he
got
off
being
like
that
i
thought
you
hated
wizards
whats
the
deal
with
that
oh
man
thats
so
messed
up
that
you
think
that
she
probably
digs
wizards
for
real
just
like
you
and
youre
blowing
shit
out
of
proportion
like
pretty
much
always
you
and
she
could
probably
have
been
chatting
up
how
awesome
wizards
were
this
whole
time
but
no
youre
probably
burning
your
nutjob
meow
book
to
spite
her
too
arent
you
oh
yeah
i
thought
that
was
a
joke
when
did
they
say
that
you
mean
when
we
were
dancing
and
stuff
in
our
dreams
ive
never
seen
or
heard
these
things
in
my
dreams
uh
yeah
no
what
a
ridiculous
question
dunno
anyway
yeah
i
guess
ill
do
that
get
some
sky
monsters
to
boss
me
around
sounds
cool
