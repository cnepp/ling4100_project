i
dunno
why
my
friends
got
to
have
adults
around
who
cared
about
them
they
complained
bitterly
about
stuff
so
i
guess
i
convinced
myself
they
were
all
in
the
same
boat
as
me
but
thats
not
how
it
was
their
complaints
were
trumped
up
nonsense
and
i
bought
it
cause
i
dunno
i
didnt
have
any
frame
of
reference
but
his
dad
and
her
mom
no
matter
what
they
said
it
was
so
obvious
they
cared
about
them
deeply
even
jades
weird
fuckin
grandpa
who
died
when
she
was
young
obviously
would
have
done
anything
for
her
why
did
i
get
such
a
raw
cut
of
the
asshole
deck
and
why
did
it
take
me
so
long
to
figure
that
out
and
like
hes
dead
now
so
thats
that
so
all
thats
left
to
do
is
look
back
and
try
to
put
the
pieces
together
of
my
first
years
and
all
i
can
think
is
what
the
fuck
was
that
i
dont
come
away
with
the
impression
i
used
to
try
convincing
myself
of
that
he
was
like
mysterious
or
stern
or
aloof
the
only
feeling
left
is
this
insane
impression
that
i
was
raised
by
somebody
who
fuckin
hated
me
and
the
whole
act
of
even
raising
a
child
was
some
totally
fucked
up
game
to
him
like
parenthood
was
one
of
the
highest
tiers
of
irony
in
his
solemn
bullshit
broninja
code
so
he
went
through
those
motions
and
did
whatever
he
thought
was
funny
or
badass
but
under
that
weird
stylistic
and
totally
sociopathic
approach
to
parenting
i
cant
even
imagine
there
was
any
emotion
toward
me
other
than
some
sort
of
loathing
i
dont
want
to
get
out
the
laundry
list
but
for
reference
laundry
wasnt
one
of
those
things
that
was
just
one
of
the
many
little
domestic
things
i
just
had
to
sort
of
figure
out
sorta
like
i
eventually
had
to
learn
what
the
real
purpose
of
a
refridgerator
was
from
movies
i
dunno
theres
too
much
to
even
get
into
just
i
dont
remember
the
atmosphere
ever
not
being
nerve
wracking
all
havin
to
sneak
around
and
ugh
my
shitty
childhood
spider
senses
are
tinglin
just
thinking
about
it
it
was
training
you
know
but
you
know
what
it
really
was
it
was
some
vicious
shit
that
was
bad
and
sucked
and
i
hated
it
it
didnt
make
me
stronger
it
did
the
opposite
it
made
me
never
want
to
fight
it
made
me
never
want
to
see
blood
or
be
near
danger
or
hear
metal
sounds
it
made
me
hate
the
idea
of
being
a
hero
cause
he
was
a
hero
and
he
ruined
the
idea
of
heroism
i
dont
even
want
to
be
fighting
this
shitty
version
of
jack
but
hey
nobody
else
has
secret
welsh
powers
so
i
guess
i
have
to
what
gets
me
is
how
long
it
took
me
to
put
all
this
together
to
stop
seeing
it
as
some
kinda
roughhousey
and
eccentric
life
i
had
but
was
otherwise
normal
it
took
years
to
deconstruct
it
all
and
put
it
back
together
to
understand
how
fuckin
mad
i
should
be
and
in
particular
how
stone
cold
deeply
uncared
for
i
was
my
whole
life
like
being
merely
monitored
by
a
violent
robot
i
only
started
getting
it
after
spending
a
lot
of
time
in
person
with
a
bunch
of
people
who
actually
did
care
about
me
and
i
could
start
feeling
like
actually
somewhat
human
for
the
first
time
instead
of
some
sort
of
runty
afterthought
to
a
household
cabal
of
smutty
puppets
the
fuckin
puppets
i
know
how
it
sounds
but
i
am
not
joking
and
there
is
no
shred
of
doubt
in
my
mind
that
he
loved
all
those
puppets
more
than
me
honestly
it
is
very
possible
that
he
was
just
insane
and
thats
that
i
guess
it
didnt
help
either
that
we
lived
with
what
we
have
come
to
understand
may
theoretically
be
the
most
evil
doll
to
exist
in
any
universe
ever
in
fact
its
my
tenuous
understanding
that
he
came
down
to
earth
with
that
thing
and
like
actually
grew
up
with
it
maybe
maybe
spending
some
years
being
unseparable
from
that
hell
puppet
had
some
effect
on
him
maybe
if
it
hadnt
been
casting
a
pall
over
our
apartment
since
he
took
me
in
grinning
glaring
laughing
in
my
sleep
maybe
our
lives
wouldnt
have
been
quite
so
maybe
we
would
have
ugh
