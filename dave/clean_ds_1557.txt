im
serious
the
thing
is
being
a
time
guy
like
actually
mastering
time
travel
im
pretty
sure
what
that
involves
is
learning
to
never
use
it
see
its
like
karate
well
its
more
like
what
they
say
about
karate
that
you
learn
it
so
you
dont
use
it
but
i
mean
we
all
know
the
truth
about
karate
is
if
you
know
karate
then
obviously
in
reality
you
use
it
all
the
time
like
doing
lethal
fuckin
crane
kicks
and
sweet
karate
chops
while
walking
down
the
street
just
cause
you
can
its
a
god
damn
no
brainer
thats
what
you
do
with
karate
but
see
with
time
travel
all
the
stuff
about
learning
it
so
you
dont
have
to
use
it
is
true
theres
no
good
that
can
come
of
it
you
can
crunch
the
logic
on
the
loops
all
you
want
but
all
youre
doing
is
painting
yourself
into
a
corner
creating
inevitabilities
you
have
to
rehearse
and
enact
or
face
death
for
yourself
or
everyone
you
know
and
sometimes
facing
death
is
the
very
inevitability
you
have
to
rehearse
and
then
you
wait
and
wait
knowing
its
coming
and
knowing
it
has
to
happen
how
do
you
think
it
made
me
feel
when
we
were
gathering
up
all
those
frogs
and
i
knew
the
whole
time
in
a
little
while
you
would
have
to
watch
me
get
shot
but
i
couldnt
say
anything
or
it
would
mess
it
all
up
all
cause
i
thought
it
would
be
cool
to
be
marty
mcfuckin
fly
but
instead
of
shredding
johnny
b
goode
on
guitar
to
get
my
parents
to
bang
my
crowning
performance
was
doing
a
funny
dance
while
getting
pumped
full
of
lead
then
i
had
to
leave
everyone
behind
and
get
into
the
delorean
and
return
to
the
but
the
delorean
was
actually
a
big
purple
moon
and
the
was
me
accidentally
reaching
god
tier
and
living
on
a
shitty
meteor
for
a
while
and
i
guess
rose
was
doc
brown
