what
do
you
actually
want
from
her
do
you
want
her
to
stop
drinking
faygo
and
falling
asleep
in
puddles
of
red
fructose
corn
slobber
or
do
you
want
her
to
somehow
address
the
root
of
those
habits
and
cut
all
that
out
for
good
yeah
i
can
understand
where
youre
coming
from
but
in
situations
like
this
i
think
you
need
to
remind
yourself
theres
only
so
much
you
can
do
for
somebody
and
maybe
they
arent
going
to
want
or
need
your
help
and
you
just
have
to
figure
out
how
to
deal
with
that
like
at
some
point
in
your
life
one
of
your
friends
might
start
spending
all
her
time
with
a
guy
you
think
is
bad
news
and
you
have
to
decide
if
you
need
to
intervene
as
a
friend
or
just
let
it
go
because
people
can
change
or
drift
apart
or
whatever
because
thats
just
something
that
happens
look
all
im
saying
is
there
comes
a
time
in
every
young
womans
life
when
she
has
to
come
to
terms
with
the
decision
to
gradually
morph
into
a
juggalo
while
all
her
friends
and
loved
ones
watch
in
dismay
terezi
has
strolled
through
the
dark
carnival
and
taken
a
great
brooding
whiff
of
that
decisions
festive
asshole
and
the
choice
she
has
made
is
all
too
clear
shes
down
with
the
clown
its
true
man
you
can
live
in
denial
for
only
so
long
but
as
your
bro
i
have
to
say
it
like
it
is
she
and
gamzee
man
that
is
literally
a
thing
they
are
in
the
hate
square
together
total
kismespades
dude
oh
really
then
what
the
fuck
have
i
been
tiptoeing
around
all
this
time
god
damn
i
thought
this
was
supposed
to
be
like
this
big
secret
that
would
destroy
you
if
you
found
out
then
why
is
it
a
problem
now
what
like
i
said
i
just
put
it
behind
me
she
started
sneaking
around
in
vents
and
stuff
acting
suspicious
trying
to
hide
the
fact
that
she
was
seeing
him
like
she
was
obviously
ashamed
of
it
and
worried
how
id
react
but
it
was
hella
transparent
that
was
going
on
so
i
just
said
thats
fine
yall
can
do
your
blackrom
thing
with
the
juggalo
its
your
decision
but
i
cant
keep
playing
along
i
cant
do
the
quadrant
thing
its
just
too
weird
for
me
im
not
a
troll
and
im
not
all
open
minded
about
gettin
multicultural
i
still
dont
understand
the
spades
thing
and
it
makes
me
really
fuckin
uncomfortable
even
trying
to
imagine
how
that
works
and
i
sure
as
fuck
dont
want
to
date
anybody
whos
got
a
hateclown
on
the
side
so
i
said
no
hard
feelings
i
still
like
you
and
all
do
whatever
makes
you
happy
ill
just
be
over
here
in
the
hyper
gravity
chamber
training
to
beat
lord
english
no
but
what
about
you
havent
you
been
talking
to
gamzee
this
whole
time
or
is
he
just
balls
out
lying
to
you
about
sneakin
around
the
meteor
with
terezi
i
thought
moirails
were
supposed
to
be
open
with
each
other
about
stuff
like
that
oh
shit
sorry
to
hear
about
that
amazing
i
spent
three
years
on
this
rock
and
never
said
one
thing
to
the
guy
i
saw
him
once
tho
just
a
glimpse
in
a
dark
hallway
it
was
kinda
like
seeing
a
blurry
purple
bigfoot
with
a
huge
boner
why
is
he
wearing
it
ahahaha
the
best
thing
we
ever
do
together
is
slam
this
assholes
dumb
religion
really
its
the
most
hilarious
fucking
horseshit
ive
ever
heard
i
mean
pretty
much
all
religions
are
wrong
but
theres
wrong
and
then
theres
wrong
as
in
zero
chance
you
are
ever
proven
right
about
even
a
single
thing
dude
ever
ever
ever
be
one
sad
clown
that
day
his
bulge
will
probably
deflate
and
make
this
high
pitch
noise
plus
corresponding
flatulence
what
do
you
mean
as
friends
uh
yeah
no
offense
dog
but
thats
a
dumb
and
neurotic
question
you
forgot
the
mayor
youre
pretty
damn
tight
with
the
mayor
arent
you
yeah
the
mayor
rules
but
as
usual
you
are
overcomplicating
this
just
like
you
overcomplicate
everything
friendship
leadership
romance
shipping
grids
and
dick
battles
this
is
real
simple
our
meteor
will
somehow
tokyo
drift
to
a
dead
stop
in
the
new
session
at
which
point
we
will
keep
being
bros
for
life
or
something
i
will
start
being
friends
with
john
and
jade
again
because
they
are
my
friends
and
never
stopped
being
that
john
will
also
be
your
friend
because
hes
cool
and
also
a
doofus
who
is
easy
to
be
friends
with
jade
will
be
your
friend
too
cause
shes
nice
and
likes
being
friends
with
people
i
can
personally
guarantee
that
she
will
be
happy
to
see
you
and
as
for
the
new
people
i
dont
know
about
them
but
theyll
probably
be
your
friends
too
all
i
know
is
two
of
them
are
my
parents
and
two
of
them
are
johns
parents
and
aint
no
rule
that
says
you
cant
be
friends
with
your
bros
mom
and
pop
especially
when
your
bros
mom
and
pop
are
a
couple
of
sassy
teens
as
for
terezi
i
dont
know
i
guess
well

as
for
gamzee

balloon
poodle
friendship
lesson
secured
the
end
