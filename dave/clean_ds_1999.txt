so
am
i
inferring
correctly
from
some
shit
i
just
heard
that
uh
that
vriska
is
like
the
de
facto
team
leader
now
or
vriska
and
terezi
i
dunno
i
never
understood
the
scourge
shit
you
two
have
always
been
like
this
scheming
giggling
enigma
huddled
together
in
peapod
for
hella
selftickled
murderdorks
couldnt
for
the
life
of
me
figure
out
what
youve
been
getting
up
to
on
that
meteor
is
this
it
the
plan
you
were
hatching
all
along
is
this
like
your
big
move
your
power
play
to
usurp
karkat
as
team
leader
finally
oh
got
it
wait
no
dont
got
it
it
sounds
like
youre
just
like
being
the
leader
now
cause
you
want
to
and
making
all
the
plans
because
nobody
else
wants
to
or
really
cares
i
mean
not
that
i
even
care
either
i
just
want
to
set
the
record
straight
karkat
are
you
cool
with
this
karkat
karkat
karkat
yo
karkat
oh
my
god
dude
were
you
just
not
listening
to
any
of
that
hahaha
man
how
long
have
you
been
tuning
all
this
shit
out
i
mean
i
literally
just
said
i
dont
give
a
fuck
about
any
of
the
shit
vriska
is
saying
so
maybe
im
not
one
to
talk
but
at
least
i
had
the
decency
to
actually
be
joking
about
that
what
the
fuck
are
you
even
doing
dude
you
dont
have
to
get
the
go
ahead
from
me
shoring
up
a
lil
one
on
one
time
with
the
mayor
is
literally
always
acceptable
what
were
you
talking
about
i
didnt
hear
you
mumbling
anything
though
no
yeah
i
know
what
thats
all
about
how
when
you
talk
to
the
mayor
and
most
of
the
time
words
arent
even
necessary
like
he
just
knows
man
the
mayor
is
just
so
wonderful
i
love
him
so
much
hey
lets
all
take
turns
hugging
him
oh
nothing
really
just
wondering
how
you
felt
about
vriska
usurping
your
leadership
role
and
if
maybe
you
wanted
to
throw
a
vintage
shitfit
about
that
or
ok
so
vintage
shitfit
it
is
