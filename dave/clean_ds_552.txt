ok
id
like
to
help
you
out
but
i
dont
know
what
advice
i
should
be
giving
to
a
member
of
a
murderous
species
whos
gunshy
on
going
off
to
justicemurder
a
murderhappy
murderer
whose
done
lots
of
murders
it
feels
pretty
weird
and
inappropriate
for
me
to
be
the
one
to
tell
you
fuck
yes
go
for
it
shes
got
this
huge
murder
with
her
name
on
it
anyways
and
its
cruising
right
at
her
down
comeuppance
boulevard
so
i
dont
know
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
to
be
a
better
human
or
to
be
a
better
troll
alright
well
all
ill
say
is
maybe
if
you
kill
her
at
least
we
can
finally
stop
obsessing
over
her
why
dont
you
just
do
what
you
think
you
have
to
do
and
ill
do
the
same
speaking
of
which
these
time
shenanigans
completely
blindsided
us
they
practically
never
even
happen
so
i
hang
up
now
with
future
you
and
then
start
pestering
present
you
about
it
is
that
how
it
works
and
i
make
sure
not
to
reference
anything
said
here
to
keep
it
simple
except
like
in
an
offhand
way
thatll
seem
retroactively
logical
to
your
future
self
ie
you
right
now
if
for
no
other
reason
than
itd
be
boring
as
hell
to
rehash
it
does
luck
actually
matter
