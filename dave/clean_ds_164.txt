using
daves
spare
computer
i
saw
the
whole
conversation
through
his
pesterchum
account

just
mean
you
didnt
burn
that
book
in
the
future
that
book
was
completely
pointless

is
the
cat

of
freak

i
mean
listening
to
gross
space
mutants

my
idea
of
an
awesome
time
especially
the
ones
that
sing
oh

i
flip
out
to
ill
jams
because
they
kick
ass
obviously
yeah
case
the
fuck
closed

you
talking
to
future

out
of
the
loop
again
between
you
taking
orders
from
dream
beasts
and
bird
wing
me
with
like
future
secrets

doing
some
sort
of
spectacular
fucking
jackknife
