so
weird
being
back
here
cant
believe
how
long
ago
it
feels
since
i
lived
in
this
place
spent
way
too
long
wallowing
in
our
own
filth
on
that
gnarly
meteor
thats
for
sure
this
doesnt
even
seem
like
my
room
anymore
its
like
trespassing
or
something
like
im
horning
in
on
somebody
elses
life
a
life
lived
most
sweetly
though
i
will
admit
ahahaha
the
fuckin
toilets
still
there
i
remember
when
jade
put
that
there
that
is
perhaps
like
my
favorite
memory
wish
jade
wasnt
crazy
just
makes
me
remember
how
much
i
miss
not
crazy
jade
or
less
crazy
jade
wait
didnt
karkat
once
say
terezi
ripped
a
troll
toilet
out
of
his
house
what
is
with
girls
and
their
universally
constant
tendency
to
rip
out
plumbing
fixtures
did
i
just
accidentally
crack
another
cosmic
riddle
or
i
gotta
txt
him
and
get
confirmation
on
this
asap
actually
nah
i
probably
harangued
the
poor
guy
with
enough
of
my
bs
the
last
few
years
ill
just
keep
shufflin
thru
memory
lane
making
wistful
observations
out
loud
you
know
it
kinda
chaps
my
bulge
that
people
rip
on
me
for
talking
to
myself
its
like
the
most
perfectly
natural
thing
to
do
why
are
people
so
up
tight
about
keepin
a
lid
on
their
monologues
what
a
bunch
of
stuffy
pricks
ive
always
found
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
to
be
mysteriously
soothing
haha
talk
about
an
embarrassing
sentence
to
say
in
earshot
of
an
actual
person
well
maybe
not
the
mayor
you
can
always
tell
the
mayor
anything
