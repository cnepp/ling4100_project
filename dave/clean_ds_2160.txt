i
dunno
if
its
weird
i
just
cant
process
it
because
maybe
not
anything
to
do
with
you
per
se
but
how
i
view
my
bro
and
ive
got
to
say
meeting
you
its
not
rockin
my
world
here
or
upending
any
paradigms
or
whatever
listening
to
you
and
looking
at
you
it
really
really
just
reminds
me
of
him
i
know
youre
different
and
all
and
also
like
a
kid
i
guess
but
you
dont
feel
that
different
and
hearing
anything
like
that
like
about
idolization
or
like
you
were
actually
lookin
forward
to
this
in
any
sincere
way
is
kinda
fuckin
jarring
