nah
im
alright
i
think
that
is
all
mostly
out
of
my
system
i
mean
not
forever
because
i
dont
think
thats
how
things
work
i
just
mean
my
venting
fit
is
over
and
im
probably
good
for
another
years
or
so
and
i
can
return
to
being
mostly
deadpan
and
rad
sure
assuming
we
havent
been
killed
by
like
jacks
before
that
i
will
you
certainly
seem
to
be
the
right
guy
for
that
i
mean
like
the
most
suitable
recipient
of
my
hysterical
fits
on
that
particular
subject
there
is
no
way
i
would
ever
tell
karkat
all
that
i
mean
maybe
some
stuff
but
not
all
the
stuff
its
just
too
heavy
i
certainly
wasnt
gonna
mention
the
stuff
to
rose
or
john
or
jade
or
whoever
else
if
i
was
ever
gonna
do
one
of
my
patented
acrobatic
pirouettes
off
that
particular
handle
to
anyone
it
really
only
could
have
been
at
him
except
he
was
dead
and
even
if
he
wasnt
and
i
did
say
all
that
shit
theres
no
way
it
would
have
resulted
in
anything
resembling
reconciliation
which
i
think
was
something
i
kinda
needed
but
didnt
realize
it
so
thank
you
for
being
a
really
plausible
stand
in
for
him
who
i
could
rip
to
shreds
while
still
being
basically
innocent
of
all
that
terrible
garbage
so
you
end
up
sorta
being
like
an
avatar
for
him
that
is
much
easier
to
forgive
i
mean
maybe
forgive
isnt
the
right
word
because
im
not
sure
he
deserves
that
and
anyway
it
doesnt
matter
because
hes
been
dead
for
years
and
at
this
point
is
just
an
irrelevant
deceased
weirdo
who
doesnt
matter
anymore
i
guess
i
mean
coming
around
to
a
place
where
i
dont
have
to
feel
rotten
all
the
time
anymore
and
i
guess
im
lucky
i
got
to
blunder
into
a
reality
that
just
happened
to
have
the
exact
right
version
of
a
dude
which
made
that
possible
for
me
sorry
this
fuckin
ramble
is
really
getting
away
from
me
i
have
no
idea
if
im
making
sense
anymore
hey
can
that
be
like
the
motto
on
our
family
crest
