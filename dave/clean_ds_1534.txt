what
why
are
you
dragging
that
guy
into
this
what
happened
with
you
and
him
anyway
it
kind
of
is
hes
bird
me
that
clearly
means
i
have
a
right
to
know
you
said
he
had
issues
what
issues
was
he
talking
shit
about
me
the
whole
time
or
something
i
know
he
resents
me
for
being
the
real
man
i
knew
it
i
knew
he
was
poisoning
your
view
of
me
all
those
years
and
i
wasnt
there
to
say
anything
or
defend
against
his
slander
so
now
of
course
you
think
im
a
neurotic
douche
yeah
but
i
only
started
acting
like
a
neurotic
douche
like
half
way
through
this
conversation
you
clearly
had
an
axe
to
grind
with
me
from
the
start
and
i
want
to
know
why
what
did
i
ever
do
to
deserve
this
shit
from
you
what
i
did
when
whoa
no
way
thats
such
an
unfair
characterization
we
are
completely
different
dudes
no
i
know
i
was
playing
the
hes
bird
me
card
because
it
was
convenient
to
whatever
it
was
i
was
saying
at
the
time
i
forget
what
point
i
was
making
when
i
said
that
but
thats
not
the
point
im
making
now
he
and
me
are
just
crazy
different
yo
hes
got
fuckin
wings
he
also
presumably
takes
a
dump
and
lays
eggs
out
of
the
same
ghostly
hole
ew
man
whyd
i
have
to
go
there
ok
if
he
broke
up
with
you
or
whatever
that
was
because
of
his
dumb
bird
issues
not
my
issues
theres
no
way
i
would
have
done
that
to
you
my
issues
are
totally
different
and
probably
way
more
serious
i
dont
see
anyone
ordering
him
to
master
time
travel
or
trying
to
pawn
brittle
welsh
swords
off
on
him
do
you
nobody
is
telling
him
hes
got
to
murder
the
incredible
hulk
did
you
tell
him
hes
got
to
murder
the
incredible
hulk
jade
no
i
think
not
