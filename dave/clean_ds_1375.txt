yeah
dude
you
should
probably
ditch
the
chair
or
at
least
sit
on
it
frontways
or
offer
her
another
chair
i
dunno
its
kind
of
a
dumb
affectation
in
this
context
to
sit
on
the
goddamn
floor
so
you
can
be
on
the
same
vertical
plane
with
your
friend
while
you
exhibit
compassion
for
her
grody
clown
problem
karkat
just
threw
a
tantrum
about
a
chair
i
just
won
karkat
tantrum
bingo
