so
whats
with
the
big
book
youre
writing
in
is
that
more
wizard
fan
fiction
so
its
like
your
nigh
unreadable
gamefaq
in
tome
form
you
sure
like
to
write
big
game
guides
i
guess
ehh
chances
of
that
seem
pretty
remote
ok
totally
sold
on
that
suddenly
on
account
of
not
caring
so
tell
me
about
the
new
session
what
is
there
to
know
and
most
importantly
how
is
everything
going
to
go
wrong
this
time
ok
but
i
thought
the
whole
point
of
this
the
scratch
thing
is
it
gave
us
a
chance
to
still
win
but
youre
saying
the
new
session
has
a
fault
too
