thats
it
i
cant
take
it
anymore
it
was
such
a
huge
mistake
prototyping
seppucrow
with
this
useless
mindnumbing
jackass
im
going
back
what
do
you
mean
already
shit
took
goddamn
months
or
something
i
dont
know
im
kind
of
losing
track
of
how
long
its
been
with
all
this
time
hopping
what
else
is
there
to
know
we
lost
cant
finish
the
game
with
a
dead
heir
and
witch
yeah
well
she
had
a
big
fucking
meteor
bearing
down
on
her
and
we
never
heard
from
her
again
or
the
trolls
for
that
matter
after
they
tricked
john
into
skipping
way
ahead
and
getting
his
ass
handed
to
him
by
the
denizen
i
guess
once
they
managed
to
sabotage
us
they
were
done
with
us
and
since
john
died
he
couldnt
get
jade
in
on
time
so
whether
shes
alive
or
not
shes
as
good
as
dead
from
our
perspective
only
thing
left
to
do
is
change
all
that
theres
not
much
to
remember
i
go
back
and
tell
john
not
to
be
an
idiot
and
get
trolled
like
such
a
gullible
stooge
i
dont
know
what
he
was
thinking
even
we
couldnt
kill
one
of
those
things
yet
with
our
higher
levels
and
all
our
sick
gear
nah
itll
be
fine
dont
worry
i
dont
know
i
mean
your
whole
timeline
will
maybe
the
thing
with
time
travel
is
you
cant
overthink
it
just
roll
with
it
and
see
what
happens
and
above
all
try
not
to
do
anything
retarded
try
going
to
sleep
our
dream
selves
kind
of
operate
outside
the
normal
time
continuum
i
think
so
if
part
of
you
from
this
timelines
going
to
persist
thats
probably
the
way
to
make
it
happen
and
hey
you
might
even
be
able
to
help
your
past
dream
self
wake
up
sooner
without
all
that
fuss
you
went
through
the
true
purpose
is
to
make
a
sprite
that
doesnt
make
me
want
to
flog
myself
raw
with
my
own
brain
stem
anything
else
is
gravy
yeah
thatd
be
cool
i
guess
im
gonna
go
now
