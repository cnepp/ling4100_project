i
think
the
lightning
rounds
over
why
dont
we
have
a
distraction
to
seal
the
deal
hey
mom
i
think
harleydad
over
there
is
talkin
about
you
i
dont
think
hes
noticing
nope
hes
completely
out
to
lunch
just
like
all
the
harleyberts
thats
it
hes
right
back
at
it
with
the
bull
guy
whats
with
him
he
reminds
me
a
lot
of
john
but
really
quiet
which
is
very
unjohnish
ill
try
gettin
to
know
him
some
time
maybe
trap
him
like
a
shy
woodland
creature
then
brutally
harangue
him
with
my
typically
rad
shit
and
become
airtight
bros
right
there
in
the
fucking
woods
exactly
how
nature
intended
awesome
thanks
mom
roxy
i
mean
nothing
its
just
like
semi
accidentally
replacing
a
word
with
another
word
in
a
majority
of
instances
why
do
you
need
to
read
things
into
everything
exactly
see
rose
yall
worrying
about
nothing
as
usual
moms
fine
with
it
moxy
i
mean
romy
mommy
wait
fuck
ok
that
one
was
fucked
up
lets
make
sure
i
never
ever
fucking
say
that
again
i
cant
its
like
i
was
saying
before
this
is
a
force
of
nature
we
all
gotta
just
deal
with
striders
blurtscapades
daves
flying
boner
circus
this
shit
is
immutable
i
had
to
face
this
fact
a
long
time
ago
i
could
either
try
to
change
that
part
of
myself
which
is
an
unwinnable
war
or
i
could
try
focusing
on
being
like
a
vaguely
half
decent
person
so
at
least
the
shit
i
inevitably
blurt
out
from
deep
down
isnt
all
that
bad
because
the
bad
stuff
has
been
and
is
still
being
purged
through
an
arduous
long
term
process
of
complete
and
utter
humiliation
its
fucked
up
that
shes
joking
but
also
not
even
really
youll
figure
out
how
to
crack
her
deadpan
riddles
theres
an
art
to
it
ok
then
that
explains
everything
if
you
got
all
the
science
genes
then
that
means
some
scraped
off
on
me
which
would
explain
why
my
beats
are
so
ill
its
cause
my
science
is
off
the
charts
yeah
i
dunno
one
of
those
things
whichever
involved
more
dead
shit
maybe
i
sincerely
mumbled
about
the
idea
once
or
twice
sure
what
about
your
quest
the
shit
with
your
planet
and
the
rain
and
stuff
wasnt
there
still
something
to
do
there
yeah
exactly
i
did
this
really
stilted
like
mashup
of
what
i
assume
my
real
quest
was
like
involving
breaking
a
sword
and
unbreaking
a
sword
and
a
fuckin
bird
was
involved
and
then
the
bird
unceremoniously
died
somewhere
it
was
kind
of
a
mess
like
me
i
guess
so
maybe
that
made
sense
who
knows
what
yours
would
have
in
store
for
you
now
i
mean
if
you
even
wanted
to
bother
shrug
yeah
i
know
why
you
feel
that
way
youve
got
big
problems
with
authority
you
always
have
and
you
probably
wouldnt
even
put
it
that
way
cause
it
sounds
really
teen
of
you
and
gauche
or
whatever
but
its
true
yeah
here
we
go
again
right
except
just
remember
im
a
fraud
at
this
stuff
except
in
this
particular
case
im
totally
right
she
sees
this
quest
all
neatly
laid
out
for
her
wrapped
in
a
bow
fuck
it
even
looks
like
its
made
for
little
kids
with
like
pink
turtles
and
rainbows
and
shit
like
here
you
go
princess
its
babys
first
quest
almost
like
it
was
designed
to
piss
her
off
sburb
says
here
self
improvement
delineated
and
made
comprehensible
enjoy
your
cookie
cutter
odyssey
so
because
shes
rose
she
goes
no
fuck
my
quest
literally
starts
wrecking
shit
and
maybe
that
itself
was
always
her
quest
oh
awesome
vriska
was
eavesdropping
what
