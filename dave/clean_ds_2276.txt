i
wonder
if
he
had
like
friends
sure
i
mean
im
sure
he
knew
rose
at
some
point
because
obviously
they
teamed
up
but
as
fairly
old
people
it
sounds
as
though
they
only
knew
each
other
as
a
result
of
their
notability
i
mean
more
like
the
friends
i
grew
up
with
he
couldnt
have
grown
up
with
john
or
jade
as
friends
because
they
were
already
old
by
the
time
he
got
there
this
cool
kid
fantasy
was
probably
just
a
lot
lonelier
than
ive
been
picturing
in
my
sweet
daydreams
i
didnt
even
have
the
mayor
god
what
a
nightmare
now
that
i
think
about
it
i
wonder
if
all
he
cared
about
was
making
ludicrous
shit
and
fighting
evil
pastry
moguls
do
you
know
if
he
had
any
other
interests
i
dont
know
did
you
ever
read
any
urban
legends
about
paleontology
yes
the
scientific
study
of
dead
shit
hmm
i
guess
he
probably
didnt
do
anything
with
that
what
a
shame
maybe
he
never
even
got
the
idea
since
he
had
completely
different
experiences
but
if
i
were
suddenly
dropped
back
in
the
century
id
probably
look
into
it
at
some
point
i
dunno
how
though
i
think
it
would
be
mainly
like
some
sort
of
theraputic
interest
something
relaxing
to
think
about
instead
of
a
bunch
of
ironic
and
stupidly
ambitious
objectives
yeah
exactly
sounds
like
the
fucking
life
to
me
dunno
maybe
were
tapering
off
with
the
lightning
round
stuff
anyway
and
its
just
naturally
deteriorating
into
regular
dudechat
k
heres
a
curveball
what
the
fuck
are
you
wearing
huh
gotta
say
some
of
these
god
tier
ensembles
really
are
something
i
thought
the
same
thing
about
my
cape
outfit
at
first
felt
like
some
bozo
from
the
renaissance
festival
like
maybe
i
should
get
on
a
horse
and
sing
a
shitty
ballad
but
then
it
grew
on
me
pretty
quickly
hardly
ever
took
it
off
in
three
years
youre
right
its
comfortable
and
theyre
fuckin
magic
pajamas
or
whatever
and
they
start
to
feel
like
part
of
who
you
are
after
long
enough
i
mean
they
are
supposed
to
last
you
forever
right
kinda
by
definition
since
they
come
along
with
immortality
maybe
part
of
their
magical
nature
includes
this
insidious
quality
where
they
grow
on
you
or
not
i
dunno
maybe
this
is
bullshit
and
ill
just
wear
some
normal
person
clothes
when
this
is
all
over
what
about
you
are
you
gonna
wear
god
duds
forever
im
cool
with
deeming
it
as
such
yeah
maybe
youre
right
and
we
should
all
stop
dressing
like
tools
from
an
infinite
magic
slumber
party
for
floundering
teens
and
just
look
like
standard
floundering
teens
some
of
the
getups
are
pretty
out
there
jakes
tho
uh
damn
yeah
there
was
uh
some
palpable
awkwardness
there
sorry
im
still
tryin
to
like
wrap
my
head
around
uh
dammit
ok
i
guess
i
might
have
to
break
one
of
our
lightning
round
rules
only
a
little
tho
i
hope
yeah
ok
maybe
im
not
even
asking
you
anything
maybe
this
is
just
a
starting
point
to
ramble
to
myself
on
a
certain
topic
i
think
there
is
a
slight
chance
i
may
be
the
biggest
idiot
in
the
world
when
it
comes
to
understanding
some
things
about
my
bro
some
pieces
i
never
really
put
together
about
him
until
maybe
literally
right
now
which
i
think
makes
me
an
objective
dumbass
idk
nothin
maybe
i
dont
wanna
ask
you
anything
about
jake
maybe
ill
just
keep
abiding
by
the
code
of
basic
dude
manners
on
that
if
i
bother
skirtin
the
line
of
this
rule
maybe
id
rather
ask
you
other
stuff
instead
like
um
say
one
of
your
best
friends
is
a
knucklehead
you
havent
seen
in
three
years
and
unless
you
use
ultra
direct
and
explicit
language
he
just
wont
put
two
and
two
together
himself
and
also
say
another
best
friend
is
a
girl
you
feel
like
you
had
kind
of
a
special
relationship
with
but
you
also
hadnt
seen
in
three
years
and
shes
asleep
but
at
some
point
shell
wake
up
and
youll
have
to
talk
to
her
this
is
dumb
im
not
making
any
sense
lemme
start
over
ok
lets
say
way
back
whenever
howww
how
did
you
tell
your
friends
