so
i
guess
this
is
just
a
built
in
designix
which
is
sort
of
cool
i
guess
since
i
wont
have
to
go
downstairs
and
bang
the
hallway
door
into
the
thing
and
squeeze
through
every
time
i
want
to
punch
a
card
because
of
course
you
couldnt
have
just
put
it
next
to
the
alchemiter
in
the
first
place
but
then
i
have
to
go
downstairs
anyway
to
make
totems
and
get
cruxite
and
stuff
so
really
who
cares
