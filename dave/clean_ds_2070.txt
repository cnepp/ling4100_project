yeah
but
dunno
it
feels
weird
to
make
some
battleplans
when
one
of
our
team
members
still
isnt
here
yeah
you
know
im
sure
if
teen
hardass
strider
shows
up
with
his
sword
and
shades
and
shit
and
we
say
hey
dude
look
bad
guy
go
kill
im
sure
the
guy
will
be
more
than
willing
to
oblige
its
just
man
it
feels
wrong
planning
around
him
like
hes
a
weird
hypothetical
battle
mannequin
no
its
its
more
complicated
than
that
and
im
supposed
to
be
getting
ready
for
this
huge
deadly
battle
which
is
so
much
more
intense
than
anything
i
ever
did
even
like
years
ago
back
when
i
was
actually
doing
adventure
shit
instead
of
watching
dane
cook
movies
and
somehow
be
all
geared
up
for
that
and
meet
my
teen
bro
for
the
first
time
and
say
oh
there
you
are
thats
cool
lets
fight
this
random
nigh
indestructible
asshole
and
then
hug
bump
or
something
how
do
i
deal
with
all
this
i
think
i
could
end
up
getting
us
all
killed
and
none
of
you
are
taking
this
seriously
what
what
the
fuck
are
you
even
going
to
do
