in
the
middle
of
what
oh
i
guess
im
in
the
middle
of
those
now
too
im
feeling
heartfelt
as
fuck
somebody
bone
me
up
on
the
shit
come
on
yes
lots
um
yeah
man
kanaya
to
the
rescue
with
smart
shit
to
say
as
usual
ok
but
who
cares
about
that
so
rose
its
our
mom
hey
mom
well
not
mom
your
actual
name
instead
of
that
i
guess
roxy
i
think
i
dunno
that
might
be
weird
calling
you
that
all
the
time
rose
would
that
be
weird
so
mom
im
just
going
to
jump
right
into
the
fuckin
frying
pan
here
like
tape
off
a
no
bullshit
zone
for
a
while
if
thats
ok
captain
serious
is
at
the
pan
and
he
got
the
goahead
from
lieutenant
doesnt
fuckaround
of
the
heartattack
armada
um
i
dont
know
maybe
it
is
ok
like
its
cool
that
you
even
know
that
fact
but
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
fuckery
the
no
bs
zone
doesnt
cotton
to
no
matter
what
sorta
cookware
is
involved
or
which
pseudomilitary
organization
regulates
its
borders
i
just
have
some
questions
about
you
and
about
stuff
in
general
so
rather
than
mumble
through
a
conversation
that
sounds
mostly
like
the
stuff
we
literally
just
got
done
sayin
sweet
though
that
would
be
im
gonna
machine
gun
some
shit
at
you
lighting
round
style
i
know
right
so
you
are
my
biological
mother
and
roses
and
therefore
bear
at
least
partial
and
like
biologically
incidental
responsibility
for
why
we
are
both
so
fucked
up
but
you
yourself
are
a
paradox
clone
which
means
you
didnt
even
have
bio
parents
you
originated
from
yourself
so
you
really
dont
have
anyone
to
blame
for
who
you
are
except
weirdly
and
paradoxically
yourself
wait
ok
sorry
if
that
sounded
rude
i
didnt
mean
it
rudely
i
mean
you
did
have
a
parental
figure
who
you
i
guess
modeled
yourself
after
in
a
way
or
were
influenced
by
i
mean
an
old
version
of
rose
from
a
long
time
ago
and
my
bro
was
the
same
way
or
your
friend
i
mean
he
was
a
paradox
clone
of
himself
and
he
like
did
kind
of
the
same
thing
modeled
himself
after
why
dont
we
not
talk
about
dirk
can
we
change
the
subject
i
know
i
know
look
i
bring
up
a
lot
of
things
and
then
have
to
back
track
a
lot
of
those
things
i
bring
up
cause
sometimes
the
things
i
bring
up
are
ill
advised
to
say
or
make
people
uncomfortable
or
make
me
uncomfortable
its
just
a
thing
about
me
i
guess
so
yeah
depends
on
if
you
want
to
keep
sitting
in
this
goddamn
pan
maybe
you
should
speak
for
yourself
shit
no
mom
look
roxy
i
mean
its
like
i
was
just
saying
i
just
say
things
it
is
just
like
this
force
of
nature
no
one
can
control
or
even
try
to
least
of
all
me
we
just
have
to
cross
our
fingers
and
hope
for
the
best
and
that
my
one
man
verbal
slapstick
routine
isnt
too
freudian
in
nature
or
at
least
not
that
often
anyway
lets
pretend
i
didnt
just
insinuate
you
have
a
hot
ass
and
move
on
i
heard
something
about
wizards
you
hells
into
wizards
like
rose
ok
well
that
is
a
predictable
if
somewhat
bland
fact
lets
see
if
we
can
dig
a
lil
deeper
dont
get
me
wrong
wizards
are
ok
i
guess
yeah
im
alright
wizards
are
better
at
magic
than
me
but
im
better
than
wizards
at
rap
so
i
guess
it
breaks
even
or
it
would
if
i
was
a
pretend
jackass
in
silly
robes
and
a
dumb
beard
so
point
goes
to
do
you
like
rap
well
what
do
you
like
to
do
ok
that
is
a
fair
opinion
but
cats
arent
actually
an
activity
or
anything
cat
cloning
huh
that
sounds
like
a
pretty
dope
hobby
i
think
were
getting
somewhere
so
you
had
access
to
that
kind
of
stuff
becaused
you
lived
in
a
scifi
world
yeah
the
future
what
was
the
future
like
i
see
and
it
was
just
the
chess
guys
and
you
like
alone
no
other
people
except
for
bro
who
i
guess
was
way
off
somewhere
sounds
like
kind
of
a
bummer
thats
cool
me
too
maybe
when
it
comes
down
to
it
our
lives
werent
that
different
except
for
the
extinction
of
humanity
part
my
humans
were
just
imminently
extinct
is
all
i
didnt
have
chess
guys
around
though
theyre
actually
good
company
my
best
best
best
best
best
friend
is
a
chess
guy
hes
the
mayor
ill
have
to
introduce
you
to
him
soon
youll
love
the
mayor
everybody
loves
the
mayor
dont
worry
ill
put
in
a
good
word
for
you
pretty
sure
we
can
find
an
opening
in
his
schedule
tell
me
more
about
you
fuck
yeah
aside
from
cat
breeding
how
else
did
you
pass
the
time
haha
seriously
like
actual
hacking
so
kinda
like
john
except
i
think
he
pretty
much
sucked
at
his
codes
yeah
he
seemed
to
find
it
frustrating
mainly
his
bitching
about
it
is
literally
my
only
point
of
reference
for
his
degree
of
proficiency
youre
good
though
right
i
bet
youre
good
knew
it
fuck
yes
hed
be
all
about
that
or
i
think
he
should
be
which
is
all
that
matters
do
that
and
insist
on
it
if
he
gets
weirdly
obstinate
or
like
tries
to
pretend
he
doesnt
like
programming
anymore
what
else
you
sure
what
games
i
see
which
nintendos
that
makes
sense
thats
mostly
the
relationship
i
have
now
with
garbage
romcoms
largely
because
karkat
likes
watchin
em
so
these
godforsaken
flicks
have
helped
keep
me
grounded
in
our
dead
civilization
in
a
weird
way
but
re
games
i
didnt
have
nintendos
my
bro
had
xbox
so
i
played
that
sometimes
but
he
mostly
had
all
these
shitty
skating
games
and
like
different
tony
hawk
titles
i
would
mainly
just
play
them
to
fuck
around
like
find
spectacular
ways
to
crash
and
flop
around
like
a
douchey
ragdoll
or
figure
out
ways
to
get
halfway
stuck
inside
concrete
fixtures
and
obstacles
and
watch
all
these
cool
fratty
bros
twitch
and
flop
ad
infinitum
like
struggling
valiantly
and
earnestly
forever
against
the
shitty
and
deeply
flawed
physics
of
their
confining
virtual
prison
i
saw
them
as
tragic
figures
pretty
much
oh
my
dick
yes
what
thats
fair
meh
shes
fine
yo
thats
been
like
her
exact
top
preoccupation
since
she
was
a
fuckin
baby
didnt
she
tell
you
were
all
fucked
up
the
end
so
what
you
wanna
know
mom
rox
