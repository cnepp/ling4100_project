this
is
a
out
there
whats
up
it
wasnt
a
future
he
was
from
a
while
ago
sorry
you
had
to
see
that
but
dont
worry
it
was
just
a
doomed
no
big
deal
really
i
was
swindled
into
splitting
time
paths
along
the
way
and
that
guy
got
the
dead
end
of
the
stick
ill
be
fine
yes
you
are
go
ahead
and
be
relieved
nice
yeah
hes
pretty
much
the
guy
in
charge
of
random
teleportation
murders
right
now
what
my
bro
yeah
jack
killed
him
too
not
much
to
talk
about
this
is
some
pretty
serious
existence
threatening
shit
going
down
and
some
people
are
going
to
die
i
guess
even
crazy
hard
dudes
like
my
bro
slash
weird
covert
biological
ghost
dad
yeah
roses
too
i
thought
john
filled
you
in
on
the
ectobiology
stuff
bottom
line
is
were
all
related
slimewise
except
you
and
me
and
him
and
rose
pairways
respectively
makes
the
shipping
chart
pretty
simple
here
hang
on
while
i
dig
up
that
piece
of
shit
karkat
made
where
the
fuck
did
that
thing
go
fuck
it
never
mind
just
imagine
something
ugly
made
by
a
jackass
i
guess
meh
it
was
a
pretty
bizarre
relationship
by
any
standard
fightin
off
wave
after
wave
of
face
pumicing
puppet
ass
every
day
always
being
on
guard
for
stealth
attacks
in
the
middle
of
the
night
while
getting
up
to
go
to
the
fucking
bathroom
but
i
guess
it
all
sorta
amounted
to
some
vague
unspoken
semblance
of
kinship
if
thats
a
thing
like
if
honor
among
thieves
is
something
then
lets
call
it
camaraderie
among
ironic
rapping
roof
ninjas
but
thanks
i
thought
about
taking
his
sword
when
i
was
there
but
i
couldnt
couldnt
really
bring
myself
to
try
to
pull
it
out
it
was
too
weird
what
you
think
well
id
like
to
but
im
still
trapped
in
the
chronologistics
of
this
fuckin
one
man
ballet
there
are
loops
outstanding
and
if
i
step
out
of
line
you
get
to
see
more
bloody
daves
im
getting
pretty
sick
of
it
but
i
think
itll
be
over
soon
then
ill
break
out
and
ride
linear
the
rest
of
the
way
i
think
once
its
time
to
put
the
end
game
in
motion
til
then
youre
on
your
own
for
a
while
besides
we
cant
beat
him
look
what
he
did
to
bro
and
together
im
at
the
top
of
my
echeladder
with
all
the
fraymotifs
and
i
stand
no
chance
johns
even
better
than
that
even
though
he
doesnt
know
it
at
the
moment
and
he
stands
no
chance
either
only
thing
we
can
do
is
hold
out
until
the
scratch
guess
i
shouldnt
really
say
since
you
sort
of
lead
the
way
in
making
that
plan
yeah
well
suffice
to
say
if
we
cant
beat
him
all
we
can
really
do
is
exile
him
to
a
place
where
he
cant
teleport
back
which
hopefully
buys
us
some
time
to
try
to
take
out
his
power
source
in
a
crazy
suicide
mission
kinda
well
youre
about
to
do
what
youre
about
to
do
and
im
not
going
to
tell
you
not
to
i
wont
do
the
bullshit
troll
thing
and
tell
you
what
youre
going
to
do
and
then
just
dare
you
not
to
while
knowing
damn
well
you
will
anyway
so
ill
just
say
whats
next
is
up
to
you
and
if
later
you
want
to
talk
about
it
im
here
