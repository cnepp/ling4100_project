ok
so
all
those
questions
you
asked
me
getting
me
to
remember
you
were
just
stalling
me
werent
you
so
i
wouldnt
wake
up
and
try
to
stop
you
this
sucks
could
you
just
please
turn
the
thing
around
and
come
back
we
agreed
id
do
it
though
or
at
least
you
pretended
to
agree
just
before
going
into
a
major
league
wind
up
with
your
nap
yarn
sports
all
im
saying
is
no
one
likes
a
basketball
hog
i
just
think
you
should
know
that
in
the
athletic
arena
of
competitive
achievement
its
a
widely
known
fact
that
cherry
picking
posers
get
showered
in
nothin
but
boos
you
dont
gank
the
rock
and
steal
the
big
mans
thunder
on
his
raucus
drive
to
the
hole
is
that
the
sort
of
ignominy
you
want
see
you
didnt
consider
sports
you
never
consider
the
sports
and
yet
such
has
been
whats
happened
it
like
the
tight
end
was
going
long
down
the
yard
in
sudden
death
its
me
im
the
tight
end
and
the
quarterback
sniped
the
fieldgoal
just
before
the
nfl
buzzer
went
off
the
greedy
qb
is
you
but
instead
of
winning
the
gold
sports
prize
you
just
fucking
die
and
nobody
cares
and
it
didnt
mean
anything
the
football
prize
no
come
on
its
called
the
bruce
bombardi
trophy
or
something
for
best
pile
squad
and
even
though
youre
dead
all
these
fat
millionaires
in
helmets
just
leap
on
your
corpse
anyway
and
pile
up
and
i
mean
way
up
the
sport
pile
doesnt
stop
from
getting
taller
what
do
you
care
youll
be
dead
like
the
mission
thieving
poser
you
are
yes
poser
it
should
be
my
torso
getting
pulverized
by
that
avalanche
of
overpaid
beefcakes
and
you
know
it
there
obviously
stopped
being
a
difference
between
those
things
the
question
is
offensive
almost
as
offensive
as
you
stalling
me
while
you
peel
out
of
here
in
your
dumb
moon
yeah
but
i
dont
know
how
to
wake
back
up
is
the
thing
how
do
i
wake
back
up
