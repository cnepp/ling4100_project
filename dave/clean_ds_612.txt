what
this
thing
legendary
sword
long
story
shenanigans
mostly
well
basically
im
from
another
timeline
we
couldnt
win
the
game
there
so
i
came
back
to
help
from
this
timeline
as
a
sprite
im
supposed
to
help
him
with
his
quest
shes
doing
alright
dont
worry
about
it
so
things
kind
of
became
even
more
crazy
in
this
timeline
than
the
one
i
was
from
and
it
was
clear
was
never
gonna
do
the
quest
i
didnt
get
the
chance
to
finish
not
even
after
you
brought
the
forge
your
volcano
so
after
laying
low
for
a
while
i
just
went
and
did
whatever
i
could
myself
got
caledfwlch
the
fuckin
welsh
sword
broke
went
to
look
for
hephaestus
again
figuring
there
wasnt
much
hope
in
beating
him
this
time
either
especially
being
injured
and
all
but
what
the
hell
right
but
then
thats
when
you
lit
the
forge
somehow
well
no
not
you
other
jade
sounds
like
you
came
back
because
jade
made
the
decision
for
you
i
made
the
decision
to
come
back
myself
maybe
itd
be
different
if
you
had
the
same
chance
i
think
everyones
on
top
of
this
theres
not
much
for
us
to
do
anymore
i
guess
so
but
not
really
for
me
since
im
not
the
real
anymore
thats
a
bit
complicated
see
it
turns
out
i
had
no
idea
how
the
denizens
worked
at
all
