thanks
but
it
still
feels
a
little
odd
accepting
an
apology
from
somebody
who
i
just
met
and
technically
had
nothing
to
do
with
my
life
even
if
you
do
feel
guilty
splinterways
or
whatever
it
is
just
a
messed
up
situation
and
i
guess
i
had
to
vent
and
there
was
never
anyone
i
wanted
to
say
all
that
to
and
the
only
thing
that
was
gonna
drag
it
out
of
me
i
guess
was
like
a
teen
standin
phantom
of
my
dead
bro
just
some
perfectly
innocent
dude
havin
to
take
the
brunt
of
this
shit
what
happened
there
yeah
i
mean
maybe
its
a
little
different
cause
relations
between
peers
is
a
whole
other
thing
its
tricky
shit
and
youre
both
figuring
stuff
out
on
a
relatively
equal
footing
and
youre
both
at
the
same
point
in
your
lives
its
not
like
when
one
person
is
older
and
supposed
to
be
a
lot
more
never
mind
this
is
a
fucked
up
thing
to
think
about
but
the
bottom
line
is
yeah
laying
low
while
you
sort
out
your
stuff
cant
hurt
you
dont
actually
seem
like
a
bad
person
to
me
though
nah
because
i
dunno
if
truly
bad
people
wrestle
so
much
with
whether
theyre
good
or
bad
i
think
if
i
ever
sensed
my
bro
like
struggled
at
all
with
what
he
was
doing
or
who
he
was
or
showed
any
sort
of
doubt
that
might
have
changed
everything
but
there
was
never
a
crack
in
it
or
the
slightest
hint
of
introspection
behind
the
aggressive
cooldude
facade
if
there
was
i
sure
never
noticed
i
mean
personally
i
think
about
it
all
the
time
now
what
it
actually
means
to
be
good
or
bad
or
if
not
something
that
starkly
moral
at
least
just
trying
to
examine
the
difference
between
being
decent
and
being
a
douche
maybe
its
because
of
him
i
worry
about
that
now
but
for
me
i
think
that
internal
struggle
is
kind
of
mild
for
him
or
you
i
mean
it
sounds
like
some
pretty
dark
shit
like
grappling
with
becoming
evil
vs
simply
trying
not
to
but
the
point
is
even
just
talkin
to
you
a
little
bit
its
obvious
youve
been
fighting
with
that
which
means
that
you
care
enough
to
put
in
some
effort
i
think
that
counts
for
something
