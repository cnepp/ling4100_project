oh
no
not
the
legendary
piece
of
shit
again
its
the
fuckin
welsh
sword
again
i
dont
know
because
i
have
a
shitty
quest
is
how
didnt
tell
you
anything
i
found
this
sword
in
a
gold
cave
and
broke
it
then
took
it
to
hephaestus
who
fixed
it
and
upgraded
it
to
the
deringer
and
sent
that
to
me
and
i
broke
it
again
i
know
that
has
always
been
my
thing
for
some
reason
now
i
guess
it
turns
out
my
ultimate
sword
is
really
just
a
repaired
downgrade
of
my
previously
ultimate
sword
mixed
with
a
cueball
we
just
cycled
right
back
to
caledfwelsh
like
a
bunch
of
tools
that
is
the
most
stupid
convoluted
ass
backward
way
to
get
a
sword
out
of
a
stone
i
can
even
imagine
i
feel
like
somebody
somewhere
is
having
a
good
laugh
over
this
i
sure
hope
like
the
juggalo
equivalent
of
fuckin
loki
or
whoever
the
fuck
is
having
a
top
notch
riddlewank
at
my
expense
you
know
what
really
gets
me
is
this
shitty
welsh
sword
presumably
consisted
of
those
ingredients
all
along
which
just
makes
me
want
to
travel
back
in
time
to
perform
a
mutually
assisted
suicide
with
myself
me
and
other
can
take
turns
suffocating
each
other
with
our
own
dumbass
capes
jade
this
is
stupid
my
quest
is
a
stupid
piece
of
garbage
quest
for
lame
shitty
loser
fuckheads
who
suck
balls
while
crapping
their
pants
i
need
help
