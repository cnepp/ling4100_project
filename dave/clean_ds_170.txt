what
fuck
off
youre
the
annoying
blind
one
arent
you
told
me
about
you
man
im
telling
you
burns
like
that
are
unreal
where
do
you
even
get
a
burn
thats
that
sick
no
you
messed
that
up
uh
did
you
try
to
draw
shades
on
his
face
and
miss
whats
even
the
point
hes
already
wearing
shades
this
is
moronic
i
dont
know
what
it
smells
like
or
tastes
like
but
i
sure
as
hell
know
what
it
looks
like
like
a
fuckin
symphony
on
my
retinas
shit
is
beautiful
like
a
little
vermilion
picnic
on
my
hands
every
day
i
open
my
eyes
i
find
poetry
in
even
the
simplest
things
just
one
of
those
little
joys
in
life
you
take
for
granted
you
know
this
miraculous
gift
of
vision
i
could
give
myself
a
hernia
trying
to
be
as
big
a
douche
as
that
guy
i
could
try
but
it
would
wind
up
like
a
motorcycle
stunt
gone
horribly
wrong
my
broken
body
would
flop
and
tumble
around
like
a
rag
doll
and
yet
as
much
as
that
guys
the
tooliest
dude
i
could
ever
hope
to
meet
he
and
i
would
still
get
along
famously
cause
we
can
both
see
just
him
and
me
havin
a
see
party
like
a
couple
of
eagle
eyed
bros
peepin
shit
up
into
the
wee
hours
i
guess
but
youll
have
to
be
careful
not
to
stumble
around
bumping
into
all
the
gorgeous
masterpieces
hanging
around
everywhere
god
so
beautiful
to
look
at
with
my
perfect
eyesight
yeah
thats
fine
dont
care
