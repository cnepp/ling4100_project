yeah
ok
questions
about
me
hmm
lets
see
ok
first
the
fuck
of
all
what
happened
to
ben
stiller
wow
did
my
adult
self
get
pissed
about
stiller
i
bet
he
got
pissed
what
the
fuck
how
fucking
dare
that
woman
so
then
he
tried
to
kill
the
batterwitch
right
who
is
the
same
exact
alien
as
the
condesce
in
this
session
so
does
john
know
that
he
is
literally
about
to
go
fight
betty
crocker
yet
or
what
nah
i
mean
not
to
my
or
his
knowledge
he
just
fuckin
hated
that
company
for
some
reason
i
think
his
reason
was
literally
as
mundane
as
just
being
slightly
overexposed
to
cake
thats
classic
john
though
he
doesnt
get
pissed
about
anything
except
for
the
absolute
dumbest
shit
but
i
guess
his
instincts
were
right
in
this
case
maybe
we
should
just
not
tell
him
that
hes
fightin
crocker
i
think
the
poor
dude
has
probably
had
enough
mental
breakdowns
for
one
adventure
we
all
have
yeah
well
i
guess
we
could
have
hung
out
there
a
few
minutes
longer
i
mean
you
wouldnt
have
got
much
outta
jade
who
is
stuck
in
permanap
mode
just
like
old
times
i
guess
she
used
to
sleep
a
lot
but
yeah
there
wasnt
much
time
except
for
like
a
bunch
of
heys
and
oh
nice
to
meet
yous
and
also
i
think
i
would
have
still
been
a
shitty
train
wreck
socially
if
we
all
just
hunkered
down
right
then
and
there
for
another
extensive
round
of
freestyle
paltalk
i
guess
jake
was
kinda
like
your
john
of
the
group
huh
wait
that
was
a
pretty
dumb
observation
never
mind
john
and
i
never
really
had
anything
like
a
falling
out
except
for
not
talkin
to
each
other
for
a
few
years
on
account
of
being
on
a
meteor
and
boat
respectively
but
i
guess
you
two
had
some
buddy
troubles
or
somethin
what
happened
wait
you
you
dated
jake
so
you
hmm
nothing
i
think
were
breakin
one
of
the
rules
here
this
tangent
got
too
personal
