i
made
enough
money
yet
ok

bout
time
what
took
so
long
k
cool
lets
see
it
damn
thats
incredible
oh
shit
really
that
loud
sound
of
shock
you
just
smelled
was
my
jaw
hitting
the
floor
yeah
i
mean
i
cant
possibly
argue
with
any
of
that
so
are
we
done
making
money
yet
or
what
yeah
i
kinda
figured
im
not
complaining
but
you
said
there
was
something
specific
we
were
working
toward
here
i
mean
aside
from
buying
up
all
the
nastiest
fraymotifs
competitive
man
dont
matter
what
i
do
im
not
gonna
outpace
egbert
hey
its
not
like
the
futures
a
mystery
or
anything
weve
both
seen
it
well
ive
seen
it
youve
just
caught
a
whiff
of
it
like
a
hungry
beggar
loitering
cross
the
street
of
an
olive
garden
just
cause
a
filthy
vagrants
barred
from
entry
dont
mean
a
dude
doesnt
know
italian
foods
nearby
its
a
fucking
fact
to
his
nose
yeah
fine
so
whats
the
other
thing
we
were
accomplishing
here
does
that
get
to
be
not
an
obnoxious
secret
yet
ok
so
this
was
your
game
to
get
rich
off
me
alright
well

not
like
i
even
have
a
problem
parting
with
this
useless
bullshit
money
how
much
do
you
need
thats
all
i
can
afford
to
give
you
a
fuckload
more
than

give
you
an
even
boonbank

whats
up
with
that
number
ive
seen
it
around
whats
that

mean
i
can
do
that
then
why
werent
we
just
wiring
money
into
the
past
for
these
investment
escapades
instead
of
doing
all
this
time
traveling
oh
yeah
i
knew
that
its
just
frustrating
sometimes
its
like
paradox
space
makes
you
do
everything
the
hard
way

comic
