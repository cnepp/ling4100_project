yeah
more
or
less
i
never
really
studied
how
it
went
down
all
that
closely
i
just
figured
when
the
time
came
to
sort
it
out
the
right
thing
to
do
would
be
obvious
like
it
is
now
managing
the
loops
is
a
balance
of
careful
planning
and
just
rolling
with
your
in
the
moment
decisions
and
trusting
they
were
the
ones
you
were
always
supposed
to
make
by
now
im
pretty
used
to
having
my
intuition
woven
into
the
fabric
of
the
alpha
timeline
yeah
i
know
