getting
tired
of
wasting
good
material
on
you
guys
its
like
youve
got
nothing
its
always
one
of
you
sprouting
up
and
ranting
about
how
hard
im
about
to
get
trolled
with
no
ensuing
substance
you
dont
even
know
anything
about

of
you

innuendo

future

i
supposed
to
look
forward
to
you
whipping
up
this
titanic
hankerin
for
my
knob
be
honest
with
me
cause
im
busy
and
i
want
to
know
exactly
when
i
got
to
clear
some
space
in
my
calendar
for
when
some
fuckwit
blunders
out
of
a
magical
phone
booth
and
makes
a
balladinspiring
play
for
my
throbbing
beef
truncheon
no
man
look
i
just
need
to
know
when
to
be
there
when
the
stars
come
into
alignment
and
your
flux
capacitor
lets
you
finally
sate
your
meteoric
greed
for
crotchdachshund
i
wouldnt
want
to
miss
it
and
cause
a
paradox
or
something
itd
suck
if
the
universe
blew
up
on
account
of
you
missing
your
window
of
opportunity
to
help
yourself
to
a
pubescent
boys
naked
spam
porpoise
