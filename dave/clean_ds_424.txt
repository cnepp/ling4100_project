then
this
is
kind
of
useless
isnt
it
i
thought
you
were
bringing
me
back
here
to
finish
a
stable
time
loop
not
murder
a
guy
you
punked
whos
gonna
die
regardless
whats
the
fucking
point
of
giving
a
doomed
version
of
myself
superpowers
anyway
its
just
the
worst
thing
when
you
get
morbid
anyway
maybe
but
i
kind
of
doubt
thats
how
it
works
i
mean
doomed
means
doomed
doesnt
it
the
loopholes
are
only
temporary
like
look
how
turned
out
am
i
wrong
in
guessing
that
shouldnt
you
know
better
than
me
i
dont
know
what
does
being
a
seer
of
mind
actually
mean
oh
ok
its
someone
who
asks
a
bunch
of
dumb
riddles
i
figured
it
out
already
lets
not
get
derailed
here
we
were
talking
about
a
serious
issue
and
im
standing
over
my
soon
to
be
corpse
while
holding
a
fucking
sword
punishing
i
guess
