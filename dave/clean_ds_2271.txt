damn
and
i
thought
our
houses
were
pointlessly
tall
before
it
just
doesnt
stop
from
keep
constantly
getting
more
and
more
vertically
enormous
haha
yeah
we
made
sure
as
fuck
not
to
come
right
out
and
literally
describe
that
building
as
tall
we
are
way
on
the
same
page
philosophically
here
sounds
like
a
club
for
losers
to
me
theyre
lucky
they
dont
have
any
members
otherwise
theyd
all
be
lame
as
hell
so
uh
why
do
the
houses
need
to
be
so
tall
again
i
never
actually
understood
that
except
to
reach
the
gates
but
once
we
all
figured
out
how
to
fly
and
shit
that
became
so
pointless
oh
how
do
you
know
this
do
you
guys
have
like
a
manual
or
so
youre
in
communication
with
him
like
right
now
right
and
uh
why
did
you
make
that
thing
again
not
that
you
ever
told
me
before
again
is
just
like
a
stammering
tackon
to
that
sentence
so
as
to
try
and
not
sound
too
fucking
rude
so
you
just
straight
up
programmed
a
copy
of
your
brain
yeah
me
too
i
mean
about
my
interests
and
stuff
hmm
i
guess
i
started
some
projects
i
regretted
but
nothin
like
making
a
milk
weirdo
eventually
exist
it
sounds
fucked
up
but
is
also
kind
of
an
awesome
story
in
its
own
way
maybe
im
lucky
i
was
never
that
good
with
computers
now
computer
art
thats
a
different
story
ok
it
actually
isnt
i
fuckin
suck
at
that
too
but
dammit
i
try
my
best
and
make
some
magic
happen
at
least
in
my
own
mind
so
maybe
thats
good
enough
yeah
i
mean
i
did
captchalogue
my
own
ghost
brain
once
but
i
didnt
know
what
to
make
of
that
and
thought
it
was
kinda
weird
so
that
never
really
went
anywhere
probably
for
the
best
for
real
my
bro
did
cool
things
with
computers
too
i
mean
nothin
like
making
a
clone
of
his
brain
or
anything
thank
god
just
some
absurd
bullshit
with
web
bots
and
stuff
mostly
to
help
prop
up
his
various
enterprises
yeah
but
with
puppets
of
course
it
was
always
about
the
puppets
he
made
all
these
porn
bots
that
would
just
talk
to
each
other
in
a
chatroom
endlessly
all
like
gettin
each
other
riled
up
about
squishy
bottoms
and
whatnot
actually
it
was
pretty
entertaining
to
watch
them
go
at
it
for
hours
i
think
they
may
have
been
teetering
on
the
threshold
of
something
resembling
self
awareness
except
they
only
seemed
to
apply
that
faculty
to
reach
even
more
heightened
states
of
sexual
excitement
for
a
bunch
of
nude
soft
puppets
yeah
you
know
he
did
some
cool
things
it
wasnt
necessarily
all
inherently
terrible
things
i
would
really
appreciate
under
better
circumstances
he
definitely
had
a
lot
of
drive
and
also
some
uh
ideas
that
warranted
a
certain
amount
of
respect
i
guess
he
just
maybe
should
not
have
been
allowed
near
a
child
sall
im
sayin
