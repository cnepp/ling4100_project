some
horrorterror
chirping
at
you
during
one
of
your
nap
bubble

not
the
point
i
just
wanted
to
say
i
just
saw
you

appeared
for
a
second
shooting
at
an
imp
then
you
disappeared
no
you
can
kill
them
youll
get
better
dont
worry
three
places
i
remember
seeing
you
twice
before
in
different
locations
but
at
the
moment
im
standing
in
the
middle
of
this
snowy
goddamn
field
freezing
my
shit
off
just
wanted
to
see
if
you
were
cool
no
i
was
this
is
future
me
one
of
the
future
mes
that
is
yeah
jade

what
future
me
means
yeah

pretty
fucking
cold
so
im
gonna
go
some
place

a
while
later

hour
later

hour
for
me
a
second
for
you

ran
around
for
an
hour
got
my
ass
some
place
warm
went
back
in
time
picked
up
where
we
left
off
yeah
i
guess
im
sorta
used
to
it
by
now
i
dont
think
of
hours
going
by
the
same
way
anymore
i
mean
they
are
my
hours
but
not
everyone
elses
theyre
kind
of
like
private
hours
all
to
myself
while
everyone
else
is
sort
of
in
slow
motion
stuck
in
the
thick
of
the
alpha
well
yeah
my
thing
is
time
yours
is
space
pretty
different
things
you
get
things
about
space
i
dont
or
you
will
yup
pretty
believable
since
you
lived
on
guam
or
wherever
the
fuck
and
also
inside
an
active
volcano
well
ive
never
seen
it
either
now
that
i
think
about
it
no
nah
lavas
better
yeah
it
is
lava
and
skeletal
skyscrapers
all
melting
and
shit
how
is
that
not
way
cooler
than
snow
and
like
more
snow
snows
a
big
chilly
carpet
of
nobody
gives
a
shit
like
old
man
winter
spread
around
his
nasty
mayonnaise
and
turned
the
landscape
into
his
personal
asshole
sandwich
when
i
look
around
all
i
see
is
the
miles
of
unharnessed
snowmen
im
just
too
damn
cool
to
build
whoa
jade
with
the
fucking
haymaker
i
need
to
go
look
for
my
teeth
on
the
canvas
as
soon
as
shit
stops
spinning
and
there
stops
being
like
ten
of
you
time
time
time
then
shades
time
time
shades
lets
go
oh
my
fucking
god
im
not
gonna
play
in
the
snow
maybe
you
missed
those
credentials
i
flashed
which
clearly
stated
me
being
too
cool
for
that
like
federally
too
cool
my
coolness
is
named
after
a
dead
president
plus
his
middle
initial
to
make
it
sound
extra
legit
ok
i
thought
you
were
going
inside
well
at
least
make
some
damn
clothes
something
warmer
why
dont
you
alchemize
some
shit
blew
up
i
completely
understand
everything
about
that
practically
entirely
no
dont
bother
