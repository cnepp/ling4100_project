who
were
you
talking
to
just
telling
a
troll
to
step
off
ok
cool
so
now
that
youre
a
sprite
do
you
know
everything
about
the
game
well
i
knew
a
lot
anyway
cause
im
from
the
future
but
yeah
i
know
more
stuff
now
like
things
meant
specifically
for
sprites
to
clue
players
in
on
but
packaged
in
these
like
i
guess
riddles
im
supposed
to
be
cagey
about
it
but
i
dont
really
feel
like
it
ask
me
anything
go
ahead
ill
give
you
a
straight
answer
alright
here
goes
why
are
we
so
fucking
awesome
thats
the
best
fucking
question
anybody
ever
asked
yeah
so
is
everything
cool
with
this
john
business
is
he
gonna
be
ok
thats
up
to
him
if
he
decides
to
wise
up
and
listen
to
us
if
not
then
we
just
bail
everyone
out
yet
again
ok
all
that
gear
you
picked
up
should
let
you
breeze
through
the
first
couple
gates
even
at
a
low
level
later
youll
unlock
the
ability
to
bring
your
sprite
down
with
you
and
well
take
care
of
shit
together
til
then
i
guess
just
mess
around
and
let
jade
build
up
or
whatever
ill
go
kill
some
time
maybe
draw
some
comics
like
what
i
dont
know
whats
the
last
one
you
did
i
was
in
the
middle
of
the
nancho
party
arc
oh
yeah
i
gave
up
on
that
half
way
through
yeah
that
was
sorta
the
plan
making
a
ten
part
story
about
nachos
was
always
a
bullshit
idea
lets
do
some
brainstorming
later
blow
everyones
minds
yeah
sure
