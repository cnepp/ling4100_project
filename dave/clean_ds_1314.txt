i
guess
she
left
already
maybe
there
was
an
emergency
somewhere
and
her
doggy
senses
led
her
there
maybe
someone
fell
down
a
well
what
do
you
think
john
do
you
think
our
teen
parents
fell
down
a
well
nah
i
sincerely
doubt
that
any
of
them
would
be
that
pathetic
whatever
it
was
it
must
have
been
important
enough
for
jade
to
ditch
us
like
this
either
that
or
maybe
she
was
that
desperate
to
finally
get
away
from
me
between
you
and
me
john
i
didnt
really
handle
things
with
her
as
well
as
i
could
have
oh
well
maybe
real
will
treat
her
better
or
not
i
dont
know
i
did
her
a
favor
cutting
bird
out
of
her
life
nobody
really
deserves
bird
as
a
boyfriend
or
a
friend
or
anything
its
like
getting
one
of
the
janky
daves
from
the
bargain
bin
at
the
depot
or
one
of
the
marked
down
daves
the
day
after
national
day
its
like
somebody
taxedermized
your
and
expected
you
not
to
notice
feathers
what
feathers
haha
no
that
is
totally
normal
and
ok
you
should
just
go
back
to
being
bros
with
real
when
you
see
him
ill
be
fine
ill
just
flap
around
and
do
my
thing
alone
im
completely
alright
with
that
at
this
point
we
had
our
ups
and
downs
john
but
all
in
all
it
was
cool
to
go
on
this
road
trip
with
you
there
were
some
times
man
the
times
im
telling
you
they
were
unreal
i
bet
you
people
would
pay
good
money
to
see
every
second
of
the
madcap
stunts
that
were
going
down
on
this
ship
basically
if
hulls
could
talk
wow
haha
just
joking
it
was
seriously
boring
as
hell
but
i
mean
it
was
still
cool
so
yeah
hey
whats
that
ring
anyway
ive
seen
you
with
that
ring
before
and
i
guess
i
was
just
like
ok
john
has
a
magic
ring
for
some
reason
no
need
to
mention
that
or
anything
but
where
did
you
even
get
it
you
cant
even
hear
me
you
got
your
snooze
on
so
hard
aint
gonna
wake
you
up
to
hassle
you
about
no
ring
i
probably
should
have
said
all
this
stuff
when
you
were
awake
anyway
like
the
stuff
about
friendship
fuck
it
ill
just
leave
another
one
of
my
patented
magic
notes
taped
to
your
shoe
or
your
cowlick
or
something
my
magic
notes
rule
ill
miss
leavin
em
taped
on
stuff
