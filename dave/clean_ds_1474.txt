aw
hell
its
my
old
dead
things
collection
what
a
stupid
blast
from
the
past
i
seriously
cannot
remember
if
i
was
sincere
with
this
shit
i
was
probably
trying
to
flex
my
underdeveloped
irony
muscles
like
the
shrimpiest
kid
at
the
hipster
gym
why
does
my
childhood
room
have
to
be
such
a
predictable
museum
of
embarrassments
i
dont
know
some
of
these
things
are
kind
of
cool
actually
like
from
a
standpoint
of
objective
reevaluation
afforded
by
the
sobering
maturity
that
comes
with
being
literally
grown
up
now
dead
things
are
actually
pretty
rad
i
feel
like
if
i
was
legitmately
into
all
this
then
more
should
have
come
of
the
interest
like
there
could
have
been
like
entire
conversations
about
it
that
never
even
took
place
hey
rose
youll
never
guess
what
im
excited
about
and
have
loads
of
dialogue
to
spill
over
whats
that
ancient
mollusks
hmmmmmmmm
said
rose
how
many
bananas
do
you
think
this
paw
clutched
back
when
it
was
alive
and
attached
to
a
monkey
i
really
must
say
this
conversation
blows
yeah
sorry
maybe
i
could
have
really
developed
this
interest
maybe
i
could
have
been
something
cool
as
a
result
like
what
even
profession
is
this
a
dead
shit
ogler
no
wait
probably
a
paleontologist
or
something
i
could
have
been
a
paleontologist
instead
of
what
i
became
which
was
uh
some
pajama
packing
fuckface
from
the
renaissance
fair
that
would
have
been
the
dopeness
