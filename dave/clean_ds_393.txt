oh
right
the
green
sun
ok
wait
sorry
i
mean
the
green
sun
my
bad
whats
the
deal
with
this
thing
i
mean
aside
from
giving
jades
dog
his
devil
powers
and
by
extension
i
guess
jack
yeah
how
big
i
need
a
sense
of
scale
here
is
it
like
the
size
of
our
sun
or
bigger
or
is
it
only
as
big
as
like
planet
fucking
jupiter
ok
thats
pretty
fucking
big
see
how
important
that
contextualization
was
now
i
know
how
fucking
impressed
i
should
be
i
mean
hopy
shit
thats
huge
so
ok
i
make
a
map
to
this
thing
with
the
help
of
a
million
rambunctious
gross
tentacle
mutants
and
then
i
guess
we
go
there
for
some
reason
why
do
we
need
a
map
cant
they
just
tell
us
what
direction
its
in
point
a
spaceship
that
way
blast
off
to
adventure
i
can
kind
of
get
that
time
is
messed
up
there
with
like
loops
and
causality
paradoxes
and
shit
like
that
being
the
knight
of
time
here
not
really
sure
why
navigating
the
space
would
be
a
problem
though
space
isnt
my
thing
remember
what
is
it
like
full
of
wormholes
or
something
i
thought
you
werent
supposed
to
know
shit
about
either
seeing
as
youre
the
seer
whatever
that
means
fair
enough
so
i
take
my
map
and
fly
to
this
thing
ok
you
fly
to
it
then
what
