yeah
so
that
covers
how
he
died
taking
a
futile
stand
against
some
unbeatable
foe
cant
say
im
too
surprised
about
that
cause
what
else
is
even
new
what
about
his
early
life
though
guess
i
arrived
around
the
same
year
my
bro
did
in
my
universe
just
came
down
on
the
same
dead
horse
i
rode
in
on
into
a
world
full
of
opportunities
how
did
i
get
started
i
guess
the
one
thing
we
know
for
sure
is
i
didnt
find
a
kid
in
a
crater
and
take
him
under
my
wing
that
was
probably
for
the
best
actually
maybe
its
better
that
most
of
his
story
is
left
to
my
imagination
kinda
like
how
you
said
you
spent
a
lot
of
time
thinkin
about
him
filling
in
the
gaps
of
his
ridiculous
exploits
like
what
actually
wait
dont
tell
me
at
least
not
now
maybe
down
the
road
it
would
be
cool
to
hear
some
i
think
id
prefer
to
fill
in
the
blanks
myself
for
a
while
really
it
sounds
dope
as
hell
to
imagine
that
sort
of
blank
canvas
life
dropped
on
earth
as
a
kid
in
the
or
or
whatever
with
no
bossy
adult
to
reel
me
in
and
just
having
to
figure
stuff
out
especially
knowing
that
many
years
later
it
all
worked
out
ok
really
wonder
what
i
did
was
i
like
some
homeless
eighties
ragamuffin
jesus
christ
that
sounds
fairly
adorable
if
so
maybe
i
slept
in
an
alley
on
a
bed
of
rubix
cubes
and
alf
merchandise
or
maybe
i
offered
my
old
school
rap
services
for
food
yes
exactly
this
sounds
like
exactly
the
life
for
me
what
if
without
a
penny
to
my
name
and
the
wind
at
my
back
i
hopped
a
boxcar
to
the
big
apple
because
as
a
dumb
child
i
naively
believed
thats
where
they
made
all
the
apple
juice
id
be
sorely
disappointed
when
i
got
there
but
it
wouldnt
matter
because
id
probably
scrape
together
a
living
on
off
off
off
broadway
like
making
shitty
cartoons
on
stage
and
saying
you
guys
this
will
be
so
much
funnier
once
the
internet
happens
trust
me
then
the
aristocratic
patrons
of
fine
theater
just
shrug
and
dump
their
shillings
into
my
orphan
hat
hahaha
