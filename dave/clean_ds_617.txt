it
was
different
i
think
it
must
be
always
different
depending
on
the
circumstances
i
dont
know
what
the
choice
is
when
you
face
him
the
way
youre
supposed
to
but
im
showing
up
as
this
bleeding
bird
sprite
holding
his
broken
sword
so
thats
pretty
odd
situation
he
sees
i
got
his
sword
and
its
busted
and
you
can
tell
hes
pissed
but
like
before
its
like
restrained
anger
like
hes
always
about
to
just
fucking
flip
but
still
keeps
it
together
so
he
can
tell
me
he
can
repair
it
and
make
the
deringer
with
the
forge
lit
he
says
he
can
repair
anything
but
only
one
thing
and
i
had
to
choose
so
i
said
ok
fix
the
sword
meh
doesnt
matter
really
i
just
thought
making
the
sword
felt
like
the
right
thing
so
i
gave
him
the
sword
but
it
still
wasnt
all
that
simple
he
needed
lava
from
the
forge
to
make
it
which
means
echidna
had
to
be
awake
our
denizens
had
to
have
some
kind
of
truce
to
make
it
happen
see
what
i
mean
about
it
being
complicated
so
jade
must
have
done
something
right
to
wake
her
up
and
get
the
forge
going
dont
know
what
she
did
though
are
you
sure
