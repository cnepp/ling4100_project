all
that
melodramatic
sadbabble
aside
i
think
its
perfectly
cool
if
youre
still
curious
about
your
adult
self
and
i
dont
mind
tellin
you
more
stuff
about
him
if
you
want
i
know
im
still
wondering
about
what
my
adult
self
got
up
to
kay
how
about
we
do
this
thing
when
i
met
roxy
we
did
a
thing
yeah
its
called
the
lightning
round
well
yeah
when
she
does
it
we
could
be
chill
though
when
it
comes
to
asking
about
each
others
secret
crushes
and
shit
it
is
settled
then
on
the
fact
that
we
are
a
couple
of
cool
dudes
who
know
where
to
draw
the
line
on
certain
topics
it
can
be
yours
go
ahead
shoot
i
was
a
baby
and
i
came
down
to
earth
on
a
meteor
while
riding
a
pony
with
a
pink
heart
on
its
ass
he
found
me
in
a
crater
on
top
of
a
dead
pony
and
gave
me
a
lil
baby
pair
of
shades
that
look
exactly
like
the
ones
youre
wearin
now
yeah
years
ago
john
got
me
these
for
my
bday
it
might
have
been
like
an
ironic
dare
to
wear
them
i
dont
remember
but
when
i
got
em
i
was
like
hell
yeah
im
wearing
these
gonna
rock
these
fuckers
til
the
end
of
time
they
were
ben
stillers
like
literally
they
actually
touched
his
weird
sort
of
gaunt
face
in
one
of
his
films
yeah
wait
what
happened
to
him
dunno
ask
roxy
but
yeah
we
would
send
each
other
stuff
sometimes
me
and
john
well
we
all
would
usually
absurd
birthday
packages
and
such
nice
one
time
it
turned
out
we
accidentally
sent
presents
through
time
i
mean
not
literally
more
in
a
roundabout
way
we
all
sent
john
a
rabbit
but
all
three
rabbits
just
turned
out
to
be
the
same
damn
rabbit
because
of
stupid
time
shit
wow
yeah
i
dunno
what
happened
to
johns
rabbits
either
rabbits
am
i
right
what
next
yep
i
think
so
that
was
a
long
time
ago
kinda
weird
to
imagine
him
strutting
around
with
that
puppet
as
a
kid
in
the
or
maybe
just
kinda
funny
actually
he
sure
held
on
to
it
a
long
time
must
have
gotten
attached
at
a
really
early
age
and
just
never
let
go
i
guess
you
fell
to
earth
with
one
of
those
things
too
hmm
wait
we
fucked
up
i
asked
you
a
question
its
not
my
turn
keep
firing
he
died
fighting
one
of
these
jacks
at
this
point
i
almost
forget
which
one
no
wait
ok
yeah
it
was
the
omnipotent
dog
one
the
jack
from
our
session
he
was
fighting
like
a
lesser
form
of
him
and
then
jack
got
extra
prototyped
by
dog
powers
and
then
got
outmatched
and
stabbed
with
his
own
sword
pretty
sure
was
fighting
with
him
and
almost
died
too
but
then
it
turned
out
he
didnt
but
now
im
at
least
sure
that
is
definitely
dead
and
wont
suddenly
reappear
as
a
stupid
surprise
or
anything
word
seems
that
way
not
sure
what
he
knew
or
how
he
knew
it
all
our
guardians
seemed
to
know
bits
and
pieces
of
stuff
and
did
vague
mysterious
things
to
prepare
to
this
day
i
have
no
idea
if
he
was
training
me
to
fight
lord
english
or
if
he
even
knew
who
that
guy
was
on
any
conscious
level
or
it
was
more
like
general
purpose
training
to
be
able
to
survive
some
hard
shit
after
the
end
of
the
world
happened
youd
have
to
ask
him
but
thats
impossible
i
do
know
he
managed
to
get
the
drop
on
a
meteor
before
i
entered
the
game
as
far
as
i
can
tell
he
stood
on
top
of
it
and
split
it
in
half
with
his
sword
yeah
it
does
doesnt
it
but
then
again
so
does
a
baby
getting
dunked
from
space
in
the
ocean
then
floating
on
a
weird
doll
and
then
growin
up
by
himself
with
no
adults
around
