i
guess
some
captchas
are
so
incomprehensible
cause
the
game
thinks
it
would
be
too
cheap
to
let
you
duplicate
them
like
an
anti
piracy
measure
so
the
solution
to
the
anti
piracy
measure
is
to
override
the
anti
spam
measure
well
yeah
thats
what
captchas
are
for
and
theyre
on
the
back
of
cards
for
a
really
good
reason
cause
god
knows
the
last
thing
youd
want
was
some
web
bot
being
able
to
figure
out
the
code
for
like
a
potted
plant
that
would
be
fucking
mayhem
but
in
order
to
effectively
cheat
here
weve
got
to
open
pandoras
spam
box
and
release
the
laserstation
into
the
world
with
its
leering
intellibeam
now
no
captcha
is
safe
youll
have
bots
signing
up
for
email
accounts
and
duplicating
potted
plants
and
shit
basically
robots
are
in
control
now
which
is
good
news
and
bad
news
the
bad
news
is
theyre
all
pornbots
and
theyve
got
loads
of
provocative
material
theyre
just
dying
to
share
with
us
thats
also
the
good
news
whats
it
look
like
im
duplicating
my
server
disc
