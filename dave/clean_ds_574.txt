this
huge
fuckin
whopper
im
about
to
just
say
what
no
no
ok
first
do
you
even
have
burger
kings
out
in
the
fucking
woods
why
do
you
reference
things
that
obviously
arent
in
the
woods
like
terrible
burgers
there
is
ok
whatever
im
talking
about
a
dream
i
just
had
i
mean
it
was
a
doozy
like
psychologically
speaking
doozy
is
a
slightly
dumber
word
than
whopper
it
was
absurdly
heavy
handed
my
subconscious
was
really
slathering
it
on
like
whatever
tangy
sludge
the
king
himself
squirts
on
his
bargain
patties
its
possible
that
i
dreamt
it
ironically
i
dunno
i
figured
youd
be
interested
in
hearing
about
it
its
every
bit
as
thick
and
juicy
as
a
half
pound
of
sizzling
grade
a
premium
ok
this
is
stupid
weve
got
to
get
burgers
out
of
this
conversation
are
you
busy
cool
listen
to
this
