oh
uh
yeah
vriska
had
to
knock
them
out
they
were
kickin
up
a
ruckus
yeah
we
cant
some
kind
of
brainwashing
thing
going
on
gotta
keep
em
napping
especially
jade
im
sure
you
know
what
kind
of
crooked
ass
baloneyfuck
powers
she
got
cant
let
her
turn
those
against
us
she
should
be
pretty
psyched
to
see
you
though
yeah
um
i
dunno
if
you
know
this
or
not
but
apparently
along
the
way
our
version
of
john
died
so
she
made
the
whole
trip
without
you
yeah
this
timeline
was
gearing
up
to
be
pretty
tragic
i
guess
but
then
you
sorta
deus
exxed
out
of
nowhere
and
spared
us
those
sadtimes
i
mean
from
your
point
of
view
i
guess
it
isnt
deus
ex
shit
you
were
just
the
normal
john
you
always
were
all
zipping
around
like
a
nerdy
hypergod
saving
everything
from
whatever
but
from
our
standpoint
you
just
kinda
yanked
yourself
out
of
random
ass
nothing
but
hey
you
know
what
ill
take
it
feel
free
but
i
have
a
feeling
youll
just
be
joining
her
nap
if
you
try
dead
yeah
i
guess
so
its
a
weird
subject
for
me
like
the
guy
was
always
on
borrowed
time
wasnt
he
i
mean
that
was
his
whole
thing
right
yeah
hes
me
and
exactly
what
i
would
be
like
if
i
was
a
moping
existential
bird
so
its
kind
of
embarrassing
to
even
talk
about
ok
i
guess
it
is
sad
but
you
know
a
lot
of
versions
of
me
have
died
lots
of
versions
of
all
of
us
including
you
isnt
whats
important
that
certain
dubiously
categorized
iterations
of
ourselves
are
all
alive
here
and
now
and
hanging
out
dont
stress
over
it
we
still
have
some
time
to
kill
before
shit
starts
getting
real
in
this
session
at
least
according
to
our
vriska
in
chief
all
the
bad
guys
are
still
just
outside
the
incipisphere
they
wont
converge
here
until
a
few
hours
or
so
so
lets
all
just
sit
back
a
while
and
shoot
the
shit
and
i
do
mean
empty
our
clips
into
the
shit
like
really
pump
that
turd
full
of
lead
right
up
until
she
gets
bossy
again
and
commandeers
our
fly
brotimes
with
more
shrill
tactical
exhortations
