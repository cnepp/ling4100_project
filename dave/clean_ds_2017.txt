um
anyway
as
you
can
see
ive
been
spending
probably
way
too
much
time
with
trolls
it
messes
with
you
gets
you
thinkin
about
stuff
you
know
thats
not
too
far
off
its
really
inevitable
you
pick
up
the
lingo
they
pick
up
yours
its
like
a
stupid
cultural
melange
after
a
while
that
barely
makes
any
sense
from
either
frame
of
reference
they
take
all
their
quadrants
pretty
seriously
tbh
yeah
ive
spent
enough
time
talkin
about
it
where
i
think
i
get
it
but
ive
never
had
cause
or
any
real
inclination
to
put
it
into
practice
or
anything
word
like
who
me
heheh
yuuup
whoa
hes
back
all
right
side
up
and
everything
i
dunno
john
it
all
sounds
pretty
logical
to
me
karkat
knows
his
shit
when
it
comes
to
quadrants
it
happens
to
the
best
of
us
sooner
or
later
this
crap
is
kind
of
old
hat
to
me
by
now
but
i
get
why
youre
kinda
freckling
at
the
implications
here
you
didnt
have
years
of
livin
with
trolls
to
kinda
normalize
this
stuff
ok
sounds
like
a
weenie
thing
to
do
but
sure
have
fun
with
that
dude
that
sentiment
is
well
and
good
but
when
youre
pledging
a
vow
of
secrecy
maybe
you
should
try
to
keep
it
down
a
little
