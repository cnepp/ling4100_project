hes
on
like
his
fuckin
wind
mission
or
whatever
getting
all
his
ridiculous
magic
cyclone
powers
on
and
realizing
his
huge
blowy
destiny
as
the
chump
of
shoosh
almost
we
all
start
out
somewhere
remember
how
i
was
scrambling
up
that
tower
to
get
that
egg
like
an
idiot
what
the
hell
was
i
doing
i
was
like
goddamn
pooh
bear
in
a
tree
reaching
up
his
fat
fuckin
pooh
paw
for
some
mother
fuckin
honey
so
even
though
im
awesome
now
at
one
point
i
was
plausibly
likened
to
an
autistic
stuffed
animal
and
you
even
knew
what
to
do
you
told
me
how
it
worked
all
christopher
robinning
my
ignorant
ass
about
that
egg
but
i
was
all
like
im
a
little
black
rain
cloud
bitch
watch
me
climb
so
maybe
youre
startin
out
with
more
sense
than
me
in
any
case
egbert
lost
his
computer
and
game
disc
so
he
cant
do
anything
for
you
anyways
probably
some
shit
like
thats
what
happened
but
youre
not
completely
screwed
we
just
have
to
think
outside
the
box
here
yeah
honestly
i
figured
wed
have
to
do
something
like
this
so
i
guess
here
we
are
doing
it
well
youre
my
server
player
remember
i
need
you
to
deploy
something
first
in
my
apartment
in
a
few
hours
ill
go
back
there
and
we
can
continue
this
yeah
as
in
a
few
seconds
im
back
at
my
place
now
yeah
now
deploy
the
intellibeam
laserstation

it
costs

nothing
